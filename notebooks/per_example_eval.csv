!",0.7,"The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port (57500), transport protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested. However, the sensor-path in the candidate is less specific and does not include the detailed paths for ACL sequences and prefix lists as in the expectation, which are more aligned with the request for IPv4 ACL telemetry statistics. The sensor-group name and destination-group name differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the candidate meets the hard requirements but the sensor-paths are less precise and partially unrelated to the detailed expected paths."
