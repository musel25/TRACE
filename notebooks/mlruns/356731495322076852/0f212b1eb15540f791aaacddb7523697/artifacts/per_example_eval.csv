The sample interval is also close (120000 ms = 2 minutes). However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses telemetry-model-driven/platform-inventory/fru and fru/state, while the expectation is for inventory/entities, inventory/summary, and platforms/platform. These sensor-paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but are not the same and may not fully meet the user's request for FRU inventory entities plus operational status. Therefore, a partial score is given due to correct transport and destination but differing sensor-paths.",strict,catalog_embeddings_improved,5,0.0,gpt-4.1-mini,text-embedding-3-small

However, the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6 ND operational paths, which are more specific and include the full YANG model prefixes.
