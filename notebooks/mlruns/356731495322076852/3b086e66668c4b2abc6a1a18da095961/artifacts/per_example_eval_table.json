Encoding is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths in the candidate config (telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven\/platform\/inventory\/fru and fru\/state) do not match the expected sensor-paths (Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory\/entities, inventory\/summary, and Cisco-IOS-XR-platforms-ofa-oper:platforms\/platform). The candidate's sensor-paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but are not the same or clearly equivalent to the expected ones. Since sensor-paths are a key part of the telemetry data, this mismatch significantly reduces the score. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable, but sensor-paths must be relevant and aligned with the request. Therefore, the score is low but not zero because the transport, IP, port, and encoding are correct and the sample interval is close."],["tr-daf61a26146d3f31fc377a4c4a15544d",null,null,null,0.6,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182), and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However, the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6 ND operational paths, which are more specific and include the full YANG model prefixes. The destination-group address-family is set to ipv6 in the candidate, whereas the expectation uses ipv4, which is a minor discrepancy but notable. Overall, the core transport and destination details are correct, but the sensor-paths are not aligned with the expected IOS XR telemetry paths, leading to a moderate score."]]}
