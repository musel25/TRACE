The encoding is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor paths differ: candidate uses 'platform-inventory/fru' and 'platform-hardware-state/fru-oper-status' while the expectation uses 'inventory/entities', 'inventory/summary', and 'platforms/platform'. The candidate's sensor paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but do not match the expected sensor paths exactly. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the candidate meets the hard requirements but the sensor paths are not fully aligned with the expectation, so a partial score is given.",strict,fixed_window_embeddings,5,0.0,gpt-4.1-mini,text-embedding-3-small
