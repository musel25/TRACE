tr-451b4cf36123fdf77656af7229d4beef,,,,0.6,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address (192.0.2.124), and port 57500, and sets a 2-minute sample interval (120000 ms). However, the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses generic 'platform-inventory / inventory-entity' paths, while the expectation specifies detailed Cisco IOS XR operational paths with namespaces. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the transport and connection details are correct, but the sensor paths are only partially related, leading to a moderate score."
tr-88bd64072bcfbe01a28defe39bf00273,,,,0.7,"The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.182), port (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample interval is 30000 ms (30 seconds), which matches the request. However, the sensor-paths differ from the expected ones; the candidate uses shorter paths (ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/neighbor/host-addresses/host-address and interface-state) which are related but not the exact expected Cisco IOS XR operational paths. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the config meets the hard requirements but the sensor-paths are not fully aligned with the reference, so a partial penalty is applied."
