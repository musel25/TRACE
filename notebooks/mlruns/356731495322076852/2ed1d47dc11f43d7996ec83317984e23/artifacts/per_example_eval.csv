The sample interval is set to 120000 ms (2 minutes), which matches the request. However, the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses 'inventory-rp:inventory/rp:rp/hardware-r:hardware/hardware-entity' and related paths, while the expectation includes 'Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities' and other platform inventory and hardware state paths. The candidate's sensor paths are related to hardware entities and operational status but do not match the expected model-driven telemetry paths for platform inventory and hardware state as specified.
