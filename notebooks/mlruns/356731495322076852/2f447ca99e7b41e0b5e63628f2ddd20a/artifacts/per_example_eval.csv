However, the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6 ND operational paths. Also, the destination-group address-family is set to ipv6 instead of ipv4 as in the expectation, which is a minor discrepancy but notable. Overall, the config meets transport and destination requirements but the sensor-paths are not aligned with the expected IOS XR telemetry model for IPv6 ND, leading to a low score.",base,catalog_embeddings_improved,5,0.0,gpt-4.1-nano,text-embedding-3-small
