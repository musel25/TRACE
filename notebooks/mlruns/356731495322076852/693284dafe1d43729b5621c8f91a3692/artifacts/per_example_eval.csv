tr-4b0dbb418d5288f1142c3fe860e7a113,,,,0.2,"The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.124), port (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which meets the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths are unrelated to the requested platform inventory and hardware state; they reference telemetry-model-driven subscriptions state instead of inventory and hardware operational data. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable. The sample interval is correctly set to 120000 ms (2 minutes). Due to the incorrect sensor-paths, the config only partially meets the request."
tr-1ff49b7889463e85759cde66bacfb3d0,,,,0.6,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182), and port (57500), and sets sample-interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However, the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6 ND operational paths. Also, the destination-group address-family is set to ipv6 instead of ipv4 as in the expectation, which is a minor discrepancy. Overall, the config meets transport and destination requirements but sensor-paths are not aligned with the expected IOS XR telemetry model for IPv6 ND."
