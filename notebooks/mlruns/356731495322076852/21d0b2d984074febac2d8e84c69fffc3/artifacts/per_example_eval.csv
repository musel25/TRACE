tr-988c24c961b1cd2262801c4510435a10,,,,0.3,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port 57500, and a 2-minute sample interval, meeting the hard requirements. However, the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses telemetry-model-driven/platform-inventory/fru paths, while the expectation is for platform inventory and hardware state paths under different modules. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable. The sensor paths are related to platform inventory but not the exact expected ones, so partial credit is given."
tr-ae340454cac5b68c28f49481a0a04dc4,,,,0.6,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182), and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However, the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6 ND operational paths, which are more specific and include the full YANG model prefixes. The destination-group address-family is set to ipv6 in the candidate, whereas the expectation uses ipv4, which is a minor discrepancy but notable. Overall, the core transport and destination details are correct, but the sensor-paths are not aligned with the expected IOS XR telemetry paths, leading to a partial score."
