tr-4737819096da1dac72ff5d2a386ecbe0,,,,0.6,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address 192.0.2.124, and port 57500, and sets a 2-minute sample interval. The encoding self-describing-gpb is also correct. However, the sensor paths differ from the expected ones: candidate uses 'platform-inventory/fru' and 'platform-hardware-state/fru-oper' while the expectation is for 'inventory/entities', 'inventory/summary', and 'platforms/platform'. These sensor paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but are not the exact expected paths, which is a moderate mismatch. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable."
tr-b38a088ca65ed389b74d0fb132e70629,,,,0.7,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182), and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). The encoding is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths in the candidate are simplified and do not match the full YANG model paths in the expectation, which are more specific and include the Cisco IOS XR module prefixes and full hierarchy. The candidate's sensor-paths are related but less precise, which is a minor penalty. Naming differences and ordering are acceptable."
