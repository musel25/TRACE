The sample interval is set to 120000 ms (2 minutes), which matches the request. However, the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses 'telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven\/platform-inventory\/fru' and 'hardware-state', whereas the expectation includes specific Cisco IOS XR operational paths for inventory and platform data. The sensor paths in the candidate are related to platform inventory and hardware state but do not match the expected detailed operational paths, which is a moderate discrepancy. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable. Overall, the candidate meets the hard requirements but has only partial alignment on sensor paths.","base","catalog_embeddings_improved",5,0.0,"gpt-4.1-mini","text-embedding-3-small"],["tr-5c941cf0dc98d2c1e2acf72f9e574f7a","Generate Cisco IOS XR 7.0.1 telemetry configuration to stream IPv6 Neighbor Discovery host addresses (host-addresses\/host-address) and ND interface state.
