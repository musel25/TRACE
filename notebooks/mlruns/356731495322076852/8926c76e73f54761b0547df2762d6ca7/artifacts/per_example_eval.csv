However, the sensor-paths are from a different model (Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-oper) and do not match the expected IPv6 ND paths (Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-nd-oper). The destination-group address-family is ipv6 in candidate but ipv4 in expectation, which is inconsistent. The sensor-group and subscription names differ but that is acceptable.
