The encoding is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths in the candidate are simplified and do not match the full YANG model paths in the expectation, which are more specific and include the Cisco IOS XR module prefixes and full hierarchy. The candidate's sensor-paths are related but less precise, missing the module and node context. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable. Overall, the config meets the hard requirements but the sensor-paths are not fully aligned with the expected detailed paths, so a partial score is given."]]}
