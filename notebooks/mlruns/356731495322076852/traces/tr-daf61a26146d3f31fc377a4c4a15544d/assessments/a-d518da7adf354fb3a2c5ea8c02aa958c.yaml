rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls transport, the correct
  port 57500, and the collector IP 192.0.2.182 (though in IPv6 format). It includes
  sensor-paths related to IPv6 ND host addresses and interfaces, but the sensor-paths
  differ from the expected ones, missing the 'nodes/node/neighbor-interfaces/neighbor-interface'
  hierarchy. The sample interval is correctly set to 30000 ms (30 seconds). The destination-group
  uses IPv6 address format instead of IPv4 as expected, and encoding is not specified.
  Overall, the core requirements are met, but sensor-paths and address-family details
  differ, so partial credit is given.
