rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However,
  the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6
  ND operational paths, which are more specific and include the full YANG model prefixes.
  The destination address-family is incorrectly set to ipv6 instead of ipv4 as in
  the expectation. The naming and ordering differences are acceptable, but the sensor-paths
  and address-family mismatch reduce the score.
