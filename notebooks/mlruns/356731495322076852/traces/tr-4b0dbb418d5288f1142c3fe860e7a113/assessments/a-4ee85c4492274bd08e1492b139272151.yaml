rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.124), port (57500), transport
  (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which meets the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor-paths are unrelated to the requested platform inventory and
  hardware state; they reference telemetry-model-driven subscriptions state instead
  of inventory and hardware operational data. The sensor-group and destination-group
  names differ but that is acceptable. The sample interval is correctly set to 120000
  ms (2 minutes). Due to the incorrect sensor-paths, the config only partially meets
  the request.
