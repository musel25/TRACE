rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.124), port (57500), transport
  (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which meets the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor-paths are unrelated to the requested platform inventory and
  hardware state; they instead reference telemetry-model-driven subscriptions state,
  which is not relevant. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that
  is acceptable. The sample interval is correctly set to 120000 ms (2 minutes). Due
  to the incorrect sensor-paths, the configuration does not fulfill the main functional
  requirement.
