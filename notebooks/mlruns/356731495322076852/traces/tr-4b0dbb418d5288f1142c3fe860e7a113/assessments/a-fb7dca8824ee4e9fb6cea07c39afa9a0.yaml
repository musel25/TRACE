rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.124),
  and port (57500), and sets a 2-minute sample interval (120000 ms). However, the
  sensor-paths in the candidate are different and less specific compared to the reference,
  which includes detailed sensor-paths with module names and entities. The candidate's
  sensor-paths are more generic and do not clearly match the expected platform inventory
  and hardware state paths. Encoding is 'gpb' in candidate vs 'self-describing-gpb'
  in reference, which is acceptable but slightly different. Overall, the candidate
  meets the hard requirements but lacks precise sensor-path matching, resulting in
  a moderate score.
