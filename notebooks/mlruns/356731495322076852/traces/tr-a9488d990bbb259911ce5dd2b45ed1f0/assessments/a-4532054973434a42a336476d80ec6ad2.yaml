rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and the encoding is self-describing-gpb as required.
  The sample interval is set to 120000 ms (2 minutes), which matches the request.
  However, the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate
  uses 'telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven/platform-inventory/fru'
  and 'hardware-state', whereas the expectation includes specific Cisco IOS XR operational
  paths for inventory and platform data. The sensor paths in the candidate are related
  to platform inventory and hardware state but do not match the expected detailed
  operational paths, which is a moderate discrepancy. Naming and ordering differences
  are acceptable. Overall, the candidate meets the hard requirements but has only
  partial alignment on sensor paths.
