rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets sample-interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However, the
  sensor-paths are from a different model (Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-oper)
  and do not match the expected IPv6 ND paths (Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-nd-oper). The destination-group
  address-family is ipv6 in candidate but ipv4 in expectation, which is inconsistent.
  The sensor-group and subscription names differ but that is acceptable. Overall,
  the key hard requirements on IP, port, transport, and encoding are met, but the
  sensor-paths are unrelated to the expected IPv6 ND telemetry data, leading to a
  low score.
