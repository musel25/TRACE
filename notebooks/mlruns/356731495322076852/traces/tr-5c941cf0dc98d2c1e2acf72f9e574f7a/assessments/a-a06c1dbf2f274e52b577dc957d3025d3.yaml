rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However,
  the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6
  ND operational paths, which are more specific and include the full YANG model prefixes.
  The destination address-family is set to ipv6 in the candidate, whereas the expectation
  uses ipv4, which is a minor discrepancy but notable. Overall, the core transport
  and destination details are correct, but the sensor-paths are not aligned with the
  expected IOS XR telemetry paths, reducing the score.
