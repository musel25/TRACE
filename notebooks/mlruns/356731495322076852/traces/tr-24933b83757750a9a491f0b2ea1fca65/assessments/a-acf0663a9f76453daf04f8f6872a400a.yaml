rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.124), port (57500), transport
  (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which meets the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor-paths are unrelated to the requested platform inventory and
  hardware state (FRU inventory entities + operational status). The candidate's sensor-paths
  refer to telemetry-model-driven subscriptions and interfaces, not the expected inventory
  and platform operational data. Naming and sample-interval are acceptable but irrelevant
  due to incorrect sensor-paths.
