rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and sets a 2-minute sample interval (120000 ms).
  The encoding is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor paths differ:
  candidate uses ''platform-inventory/fru'' and ''platform-hardware-state/fru-oper-status''
  while the expectation uses ''inventory/entities'', ''inventory/summary'', and ''platforms/platform''.
  The candidate''s sensor paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state
  but do not match the expected sensor paths exactly. The sensor-group and destination-group
  names differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the candidate meets the hard requirements
  but the sensor paths are not fully aligned with the expectation, so a partial score
  is given.'
