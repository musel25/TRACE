rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). The encoding
  is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths in the candidate are
  simplified and do not match the full YANG model paths in the expectation, which
  are more specific and include the Cisco IOS XR module prefixes and full hierarchy.
  The candidate's sensor-paths are related but less precise, which is a minor penalty.
  Naming differences and ordering are acceptable.
