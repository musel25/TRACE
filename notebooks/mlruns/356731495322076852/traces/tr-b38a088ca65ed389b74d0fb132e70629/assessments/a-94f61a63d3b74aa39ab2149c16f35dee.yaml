rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.182), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), meeting the
  hard requirements. The sample interval is also correctly set to 30000 ms (30 seconds).
  However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate
  uses 'Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-nd-cfg' paths which appear configuration-oriented, while
  the expectation is operational data paths 'Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-nd-oper' with more
  detailed hierarchy. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that
  is acceptable. The sensor-paths in the candidate are related to IPv6 neighbor discovery
  but not matching the expected operational data paths, which is a moderate issue.
