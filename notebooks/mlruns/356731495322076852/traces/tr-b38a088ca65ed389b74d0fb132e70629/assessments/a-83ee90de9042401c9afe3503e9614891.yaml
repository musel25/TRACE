rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.182, port 57500,
  and sample interval 30000 ms as requested. The sensor-paths are related to IPv6
  neighbor discovery but differ in exact paths and namespaces from the reference,
  which uses more specific Cisco IOS XR model paths. The candidate's sensor-paths
  are more generic and may not fully capture the intended data. Naming and ordering
  differences are acceptable. Overall, the config meets the hard requirements but
  sensor-paths are not fully aligned with expectations, so partial credit is given.
