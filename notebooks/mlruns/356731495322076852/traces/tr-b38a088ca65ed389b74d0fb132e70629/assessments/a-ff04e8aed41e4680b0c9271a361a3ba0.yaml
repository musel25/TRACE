rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets sample-interval to 30000 ms as requested. However, the
  sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses 'ipv6-neighbor/host-addresses/host-address'
  and 'ipv6-neighbor/interfaces/interface/state' instead of the expected 'ipv6-node-discovery/nodes/node/neighbor-interfaces/neighbor-interface/host-addresses/host-address'
  and 'ipv6-node-discovery/nodes/node/interfaces/interface'. The sensor-group and
  subscription names differ but that is acceptable. The encoding 'self-describing-gpb'
  matches the expectation. Overall, the config meets transport and destination requirements
  but the sensor-paths are not aligned with the expected telemetry data, which is
  a key aspect, so the score is moderate.
