rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and the encoding is self-describing-gpb as required.
  The sample interval is set to 120000 ms (2 minutes), which matches the request.
  However, the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate
  uses 'inventory-rp:inventory/rp:rp/hardware-r:hardware/hardware-entity' and related
  paths, while the expectation includes 'Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities'
  and other platform inventory and hardware state paths. The candidate's sensor paths
  are related to hardware entities and operational status but do not match the expected
  model-driven telemetry paths for platform inventory and hardware state as specified.
  Since sensor paths are important but some relation exists, a partial score is given.
