rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However,
  the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6
  ND operational paths, which are more specific and include the full YANG model prefixes.
  The destination-group address-family is set to ipv6 in the candidate, whereas the
  expectation uses ipv4, which is a minor discrepancy but notable. Overall, the core
  transport and destination details are correct, but the sensor-paths are not aligned
  with the expected IOS XR telemetry paths, leading to a partial score.
