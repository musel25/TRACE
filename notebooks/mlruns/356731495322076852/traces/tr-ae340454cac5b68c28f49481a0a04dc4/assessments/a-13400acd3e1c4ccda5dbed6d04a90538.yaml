rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However,
  the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR model
  paths for IPv6 ND host addresses and interface state. Also, the destination-group
  address-family is set to ipv6 instead of ipv4 as in the expectation, which is a
  minor discrepancy. Overall, the key transport and destination parameters are correct,
  but the sensor-paths are not aligned with the expected IOS XR telemetry model, leading
  to a partial score.
