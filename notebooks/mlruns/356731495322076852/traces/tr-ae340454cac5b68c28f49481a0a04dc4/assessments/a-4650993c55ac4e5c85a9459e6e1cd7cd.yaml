rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). The encoding
  is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths are generic and do
  not match the detailed IOS XR IPv6 ND operational paths specified in the expectations,
  which are more precise and include the full YANG model paths. The candidate's sensor-paths
  are related but less specific, so partial credit is given.
