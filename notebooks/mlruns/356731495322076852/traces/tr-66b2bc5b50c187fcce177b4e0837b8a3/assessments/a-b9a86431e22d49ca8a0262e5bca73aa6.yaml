rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.182, port 57500,
  and sample interval 30000 ms as requested. The sensor-paths are related to IPv6
  neighbor discovery host addresses and interface state, though the exact YANG model
  paths differ from the reference. The candidate uses shorter sensor-paths without
  the full Cisco IOS XR model prefixes, which is acceptable but less precise. Naming
  of sensor-group and destination-group differ but this is allowed. Overall, the config
  meets the hard requirements and is functionally aligned, but the sensor-paths are
  less specific than the reference.
