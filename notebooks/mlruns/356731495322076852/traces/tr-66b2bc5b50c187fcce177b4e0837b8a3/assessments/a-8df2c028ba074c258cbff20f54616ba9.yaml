rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500). The encoding is self-describing-gpb as expected. The sample interval
  is 30000 ms (30 seconds), matching the request. However, the sensor-paths differ
  significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses simplified paths (/ipv6-neighbor/host-addresses/host-address
  and /ipv6-neighbor/interfaces/interface/state) instead of the full Cisco IOS XR
  model paths with namespaces. While the paths relate to IPv6 neighbor discovery,
  they are not the exact or fully qualified sensor paths expected. Naming and ordering
  differences are acceptable, but sensor-paths should be more precise. Overall, the
  config meets transport and destination requirements but partially misses on sensor-path
  accuracy.
