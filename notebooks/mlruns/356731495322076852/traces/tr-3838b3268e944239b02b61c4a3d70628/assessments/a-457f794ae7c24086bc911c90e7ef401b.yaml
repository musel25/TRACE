rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.182), port
  (57500), and transport protocol (grpc no-tls) with the required encoding (self-describing-gpb).
  The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds), matching the request. However,
  the sensor-paths in the candidate are simplified and do not fully match the detailed
  expected paths, which include the full YANG model prefixes and more specific hierarchy.
  The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but this is acceptable. Overall,
  the config meets the hard requirements but the sensor-paths are less precise and
  may not capture the exact data requested.
