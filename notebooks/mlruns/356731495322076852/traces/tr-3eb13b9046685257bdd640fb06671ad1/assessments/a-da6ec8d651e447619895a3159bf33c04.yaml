rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms as requested. The encoding
  is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths differ from the reference;
  the candidate uses 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor/host-addresses/host-address'
  and 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor/interface-state' which are related to IPv6
  neighbor discovery but do not match the more specific and fully qualified sensor-paths
  in the reference. The candidate's sensor-paths are not clearly unrelated but are
  less precise. Naming differences and ordering are acceptable. Overall, the config
  meets the hard requirements but the sensor-paths are somewhat imprecise compared
  to the reference.
