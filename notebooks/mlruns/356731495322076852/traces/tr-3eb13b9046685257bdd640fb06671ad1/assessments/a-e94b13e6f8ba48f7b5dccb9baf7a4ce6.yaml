rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms as requested. The encoding
  is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths differ from the reference:
  candidate uses ''ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor/host-addresses/host-address''
  and ''ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor/nd-interface-state'', while the reference
  uses longer, more specific paths with ''Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-nd-oper'' and includes
  node and interface hierarchy. The candidate''s sensor-paths are related to IPv6
  neighbor discovery but are less specific and may not fully capture the requested
  data. Naming differences and ordering are acceptable. Overall, the config meets
  the hard requirements but sensor-paths are somewhat different, so a slight penalty
  is applied.'
