rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  port (57500), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample interval is 30000 ms
  (30 seconds) as requested. Sensor paths are related to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery host
  addresses and interface state, though the exact YANG model and paths differ from
  the reference. The candidate uses 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor/host-addresses/host-address'
  and 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor/nd-interface-state' which are relevant
  but not the exact paths in the expectation. This is acceptable as the user did not
  specify exact model names. Overall, the config meets the hard requirements and sensor
  paths are relevant, so a high score is given with minor penalty for path differences.
