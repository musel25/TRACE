rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.182), port
  (57500), and transport protocol (grpc no-tls) with the correct encoding (self-describing-gpb).
  The sample interval is 30000 ms (30 seconds), matching the request. However, the
  sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor-addr/host-address'
  and 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor-state', which are not aligned with the
  expected 'Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-nd-oper:ipv6-node-discovery/nodes/node/neighbor-interfaces/neighbor-interface/host-addresses/host-address'
  and interface state path. While the candidate's sensor-paths relate to IPv6 neighbor
  discovery, they are not the exact or clearly equivalent paths requested, so a penalty
  is applied. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable.
