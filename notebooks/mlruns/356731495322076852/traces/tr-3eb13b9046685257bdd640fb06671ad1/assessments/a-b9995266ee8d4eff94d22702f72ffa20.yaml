rationale: The candidate config correctly sets the collector IP (192.0.2.182), port
  (57500), and uses gRPC no-tls as requested. It also configures sampling intervals
  of 30 seconds. However, the sensor paths used in the candidate config (/ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-nd:host-addresses/ipv6-nd:host-address
  and /ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-nd:interfaces/ipv6-nd:interface-state) do not match
  the expected sensor paths from the reference config (Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-nd-oper:ipv6-node-discovery/nodes/node/neighbor-interfaces/neighbor-interface/host-addresses/host-address
  and Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-nd-oper:ipv6-node-discovery/nodes/node/interfaces/interface).
  The candidate also lacks the model-driven telemetry structure, sensor-group, subscription,
  and destination-group constructs expected. The encoding is not explicitly specified
  in the candidate config, which is a notable omission. Overall, while the transport
  and collector details are correct, the sensor paths and telemetry structure are
  not aligned with the expectations, leading to a low score.
