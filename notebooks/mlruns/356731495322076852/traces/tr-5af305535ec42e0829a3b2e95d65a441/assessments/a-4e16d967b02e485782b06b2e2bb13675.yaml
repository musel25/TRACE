rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and the encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements.
  The sample interval is 30000 ms (30 seconds), which matches the request. However,
  the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses
  ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor-addr/host-address and ipv6-neighbor-state, which
  are not clearly related to the expected Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-nd-oper paths for neighbor-interfaces
  and host-addresses. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that
  is acceptable. Overall, the config is mostly correct but the sensor-paths are not
  aligned with the expected model, so partial credit is given.
