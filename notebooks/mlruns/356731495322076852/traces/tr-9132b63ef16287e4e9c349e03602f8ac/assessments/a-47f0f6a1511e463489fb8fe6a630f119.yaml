rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port 57500,
  and encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths
  differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses platform-inventory/fru
  and platform-hardware-state/fru-oper-status, while the expectation is for inventory/entities,
  inventory/summary, and platforms/platform. The sensor paths are related to platform
  inventory and hardware state but do not match the expected paths, which is a partial
  mismatch. Sample interval is acceptable. Overall, the config is partially correct
  but sensor paths are not aligned with the reference.
