rationale: The candidate config matches the hard requirements for IP (192.0.2.124),
  port (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample
  interval is also correctly set to 120000 ms (2 minutes). However, the sensor-paths
  in the candidate config differ significantly from the expected ones. The candidate
  uses 'platform-inventory/fru' and 'platform-hardware-state/fru-oper-data' while
  the expectation includes 'inventory/entities', 'inventory/summary', and 'platforms/platform'.
  These sensor-paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but are
  not the same and may not fully meet the user's request. The sensor-group and destination-group
  names differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the config is partially correct but
  the sensor-paths do not fully align with the expectation, resulting in a low score.
