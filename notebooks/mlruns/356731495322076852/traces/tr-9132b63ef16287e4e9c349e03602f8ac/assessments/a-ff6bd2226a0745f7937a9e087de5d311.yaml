rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port 57500,
  and a 2-minute sample interval, matching the hard requirements. However, the sensor
  paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses 'platform-inventory/fru'
  and 'platform-hardware-state/fru-oper-data' instead of the expected 'inventory/entities',
  'inventory/summary', and 'platforms/platform'. The sensor-group and destination-group
  names differ but that is acceptable. The sensor paths are related to platform inventory
  and hardware state but not exactly as requested, so partial credit is given.
