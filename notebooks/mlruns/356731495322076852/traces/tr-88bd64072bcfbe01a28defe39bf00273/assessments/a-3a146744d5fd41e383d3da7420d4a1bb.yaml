rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.182), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample
  interval is 30000 ms (30 seconds), which matches the request. However, the sensor-paths
  differ from the expected ones; the candidate uses shorter paths (ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/neighbor/host-addresses/host-address
  and interface-state) which are related but not the exact expected Cisco IOS XR operational
  paths. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable.
  Overall, the config meets the hard requirements but the sensor-paths are not fully
  aligned with the reference, so a partial penalty is applied.
