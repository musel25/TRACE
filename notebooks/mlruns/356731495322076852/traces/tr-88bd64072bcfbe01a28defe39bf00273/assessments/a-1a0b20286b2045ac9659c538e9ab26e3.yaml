rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). The encoding
  is self-describing-gpb as expected. Sensor paths are related to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
  host addresses and interface state, though the exact YANG model namespaces differ
  from the reference. The candidate uses 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-nd/ipv6-nd:neighbor/host-addresses/host-address'
  and 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-nd/ipv6-nd:interfaces/interface/state' which are relevant but
  not identical to the reference paths. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable.
  Overall, the config meets the hard requirements and is functionally aligned with
  the expectations, so a high score is given with minor penalty for sensor-path namespace
  differences.
