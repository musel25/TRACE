rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and the encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements.
  The sample interval is 30000 ms (30 seconds), which matches the request. However,
  the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses
  ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor-addr/host-address and ipv6-neighbor-state, which
  are not the standard Cisco IOS XR paths for IPv6 ND host addresses and interface
  state. The expected sensor-paths are more specific and aligned with Cisco IOS XR
  operational data models. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but
  that is acceptable. Overall, the config is functional but the sensor-paths are not
  fully aligned with the expected model, so a moderate score is given.
