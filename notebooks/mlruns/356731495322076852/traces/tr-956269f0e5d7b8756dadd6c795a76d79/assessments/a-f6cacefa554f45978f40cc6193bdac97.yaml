rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.124), port (57500), transport
  (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which meets the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor-paths in the candidate are unrelated to the expected platform
  inventory and hardware state paths; they reference telemetry-model-driven operational
  data rather than inventory and hardware state (FRU inventory entities and operational
  status). The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable.
  The sample interval is correctly set to 120000 ms (2 minutes). Due to the incorrect
  sensor-paths, the score is low despite correct transport and destination settings.
