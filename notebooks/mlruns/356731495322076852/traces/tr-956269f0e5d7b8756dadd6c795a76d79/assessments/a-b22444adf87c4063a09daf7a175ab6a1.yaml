rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port 57500,
  and sample interval 120000 ms (2 minutes), matching the hard requirements. However,
  the sensor-paths used (Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven/state/inventory
  and /hardware) do not correspond to the expected platform inventory and hardware
  state sensor paths (Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper and Cisco-IOS-XR-platforms-ofa-oper).
  The sensor paths are related to telemetry model-driven operational state but not
  specifically to platform inventory and hardware FRU entities as requested. Naming
  and ordering differences are acceptable, but the sensor paths are clearly not aligned
  with the request. Therefore, the score is low despite correct transport and addressing.
