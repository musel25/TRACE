rationale: The candidate config matches the IP, port, transport (grpc no-tls), and
  encoding requirements. However, the sensor-paths are unrelated to the requested
  platform inventory and hardware state; instead, they refer to telemetry subscription
  states. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable.
  The sample interval is correctly set to 120000 ms (2 minutes). Due to incorrect
  sensor-paths, the configuration does not fulfill the core telemetry data requirement,
  resulting in a low score.
