rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and the encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor-paths in the candidate are generic 'telemetry-model-driven-oper:host-addresses/host-address'
  and 'telemetry-model-driven-oper:nd-interface-state', which do not match the expected
  detailed Cisco IOS XR IPv6 ND paths. The sample interval is correct at 30000 ms.
  The destination group naming and sensor group naming differ but are acceptable.
  Overall, the candidate meets transport and destination requirements but the sensor
  paths are not aligned with the expected IPv6 ND telemetry data, leading to a moderate
  score.
