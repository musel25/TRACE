rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets sample-interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However, the
  sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6 ND operational
  paths. Also, the destination-group address-family is set to ipv6 instead of ipv4
  as in the expectation, which is a minor discrepancy but notable. Overall, the config
  meets transport and endpoint requirements but sensor-paths are not aligned with
  the expected IOS XR telemetry model for IPv6 ND, resulting in a low score.
