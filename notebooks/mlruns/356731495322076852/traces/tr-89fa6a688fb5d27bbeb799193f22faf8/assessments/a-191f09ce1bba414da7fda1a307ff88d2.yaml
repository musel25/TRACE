rationale: The candidate config uses gRPC no-tls, correct IP (192.0.2.182), and port
  (57500), and encoding self-describing-gpb, which meets the hard requirements. However,
  the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6
  ND operational paths. The destination-group address-family is incorrectly set to
  ipv6 instead of ipv4 as in the expectation. Sample interval is correct. Overall,
  the config partially meets the requirements but sensor-paths and address-family
  are not aligned with the reference.
