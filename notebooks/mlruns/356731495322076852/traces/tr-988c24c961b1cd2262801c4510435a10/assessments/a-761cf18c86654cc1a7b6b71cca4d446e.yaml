rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), port 57500, and encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements.
  The sample interval is set to 120000 ms (2 minutes), which matches the request.
  However, the sensor-paths differ from the expected ones: the candidate uses ''Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven/platform-inventory/fru''
  and ''hardware-state'', while the expectation is for ''Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities'',
  ''inventory/summary'', and ''Cisco-IOS-XR-platforms-ofa-oper:platforms/platform''.
  These sensor-paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but are
  not the exact expected paths and may represent different data models. Since sensor-paths
  are a key part of telemetry configuration, this discrepancy reduces the score. Naming
  and ordering differences are acceptable.'
