rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port 57500,
  and a 2-minute sample interval, meeting the hard requirements. However, the sensor
  paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses telemetry-model-driven/platform-inventory/fru
  paths, while the expectation is for platform inventory and hardware state paths
  under different modules. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but
  that is acceptable. The sensor paths are related to platform inventory but not the
  exact expected ones, so partial credit is given.
