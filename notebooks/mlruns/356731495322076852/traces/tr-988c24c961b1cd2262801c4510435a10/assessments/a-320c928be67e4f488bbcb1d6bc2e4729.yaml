rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and the sample interval is approximately 2 minutes
  (120000 ms). The encoding is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths
  differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses 'telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven/platform-inventory/fru'
  and 'hardware-state' paths, whereas the expectation includes specific Cisco IOS
  XR operational paths for inventory and platform data. The candidate's sensor-paths
  are related to platform inventory and hardware state but do not match the expected
  model-driven operational paths, which is a moderate mismatch. Naming and ordering
  differences are acceptable. Overall, the candidate meets transport and destination
  requirements but only partially matches sensor-path expectations.
