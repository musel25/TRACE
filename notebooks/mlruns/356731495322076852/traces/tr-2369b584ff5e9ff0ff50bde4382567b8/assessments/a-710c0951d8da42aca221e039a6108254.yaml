rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However,
  the sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6
  ND operational paths, which are more specific and include the full YANG model prefixes.
  The destination-group naming and structure differ but are acceptable. Overall, the
  key transport and destination parameters are correct, but the sensor-paths are only
  partially aligned, leading to a moderate score.
