rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 120000 ms (2 minutes),
  meeting the hard requirements. However, the sensor paths differ significantly from
  the expected ones; the candidate uses 'inventory-rp:inventory/rp:rp/hardware-hardware-entity'
  and 'state/oper-status' which are related to hardware FRU inventory and operational
  status, while the expected config uses different sensor paths related to platform
  inventory and hardware state. The candidate's sensor paths are related but not matching
  the expected model paths, so partial credit is given. Naming and ordering differences
  are acceptable.
