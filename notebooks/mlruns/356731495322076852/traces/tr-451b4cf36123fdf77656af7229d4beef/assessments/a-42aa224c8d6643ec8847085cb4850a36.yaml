rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port 57500, and sets a 2-minute sample interval (120000 ms).
  However, the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate
  uses generic 'platform-inventory / inventory-entity' paths, while the expectation
  specifies detailed Cisco IOS XR operational paths with namespaces. The sensor-group
  and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the transport
  and connection details are correct, but the sensor paths are only partially related,
  leading to a moderate score.
