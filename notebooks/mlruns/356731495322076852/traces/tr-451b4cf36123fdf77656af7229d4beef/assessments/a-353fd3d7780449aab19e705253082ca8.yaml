rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port 57500,
  and encoding self-describing-gpb, matching the hard requirements. The sample interval
  is 120000 ms (2 minutes), which is correct. However, the sensor paths differ significantly
  from the expected ones; the candidate uses Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-oper
  paths related to inventory entities and operational status, while the expectation
  is for platform inventory and hardware state paths from Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper
  and Cisco-IOS-XR-platforms-ofa-oper modules. The candidate's sensor paths are related
  to inventory but not the specific platform and hardware state requested, so partial
  credit is given.
