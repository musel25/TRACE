rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  192.0.2.124, and port 57500, and the sample interval is approximately 2 minutes
  (120000 ms). Encoding is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths
  in the candidate config (telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven/platform/inventory/fru
  and fru/state) do not match the expected sensor-paths (Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities,
  inventory/summary, and Cisco-IOS-XR-platforms-ofa-oper:platforms/platform). The
  candidate's sensor-paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but
  are not the same or clearly equivalent to the expected ones. Since sensor-paths
  are a key part of the telemetry data, this mismatch significantly reduces the score.
  Naming and ordering differences are acceptable, but sensor-paths must be relevant
  and aligned with the request. Therefore, the score is low but not zero because the
  transport, IP, port, and encoding are correct and the sample interval is close.
