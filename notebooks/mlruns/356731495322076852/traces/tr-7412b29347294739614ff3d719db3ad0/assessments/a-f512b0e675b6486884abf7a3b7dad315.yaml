rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port
  57500, and encoding self-describing-gpb, matching the hard requirements. The sample
  interval of 120000 ms (2 minutes) is also correct. However, the sensor-paths differ
  significantly: candidate uses ''telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven/platform-inventory/fru''
  and ''hardware-state'', while the expectation uses Cisco IOS XR specific paths for
  inventory and platform entities. The candidate''s sensor-paths are related to platform
  inventory and hardware state but do not match the expected model-driven paths for
  FRU inventory entities and operational status. This partial mismatch leads to a
  moderate score.'
