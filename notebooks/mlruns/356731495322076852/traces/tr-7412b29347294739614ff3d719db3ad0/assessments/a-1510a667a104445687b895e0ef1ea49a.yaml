rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and sets a 2-minute sample interval (120 seconds).
  However, the encoding used is 'encode-gpb' instead of the expected 'self-describing-gpb'.
  The sensor paths focus on 'platform-inventory/racks/rack/fru' and 'oper-status',
  which are related to FRU inventory and operational status, but the expected config
  includes broader platform inventory and hardware state sensor paths. The candidate's
  sensor paths are related but less comprehensive and use a different YANG model namespace.
  Overall, the hard requirements are mostly met except for encoding, and the sensor
  paths are relevant but not fully aligned with expectations.
