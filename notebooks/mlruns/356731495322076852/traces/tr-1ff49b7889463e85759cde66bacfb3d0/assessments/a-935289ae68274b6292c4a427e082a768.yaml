rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, the correct IP (192.0.2.182),
  and port (57500), and sets sample-interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds). However, the
  sensor-paths are generic and do not match the expected detailed IOS XR IPv6 ND operational
  paths, which are more specific and relevant to the request. Also, the destination-group
  address-family is set to ipv6 instead of ipv4 as in the expectation, which is a
  minor discrepancy but notable. Overall, the core transport and destination details
  are correct, but the sensor-paths are not aligned with the expected IOS XR telemetry
  paths for IPv6 ND, reducing the score.
