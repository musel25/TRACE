rationale: 'The candidate config uses gRPC no-tls and the correct IP and port, which
  meets hard requirements. However, it lacks the ''model-driven'' keyword and uses
  ''ipv6'' instead of ''ipv4'' for the destination address family, which is a notable
  deviation. The sensor paths are represented differently: the candidate uses sensor-class
  names rather than explicit sensor-paths, and includes two sensor-groups instead
  of one with multiple sensor-paths. Sample intervals are set to 30 seconds in the
  candidate, while the expectation is 30000 ms (30 seconds), which is acceptable.
  Encoding differs: candidate uses ''gpb'' while expectation uses ''self-describing-gpb''.
  Overall, the candidate partially matches the requirements but misses key details
  and uses different sensor-path representations, leading to a low score.'
