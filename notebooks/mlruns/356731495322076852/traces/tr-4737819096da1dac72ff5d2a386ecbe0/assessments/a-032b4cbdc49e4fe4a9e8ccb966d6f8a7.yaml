rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  192.0.2.124, and port 57500, and the sample interval is approximately 2 minutes
  (120000 ms). However, the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones;
  the candidate uses 'platform-inventory/fru' and 'platform-hardware-state/fru-oper'
  instead of the expected 'inventory/entities', 'inventory/summary', and 'platforms/platform'.
  The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable. The
  sensor paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but do not match
  the expected paths, so partial credit is given.
