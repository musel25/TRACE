rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port 57500,
  and encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements. However, the sensor
  paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses platform-inventory/fru
  and platform-hardware-state/fru-oper, while the expectation is for inventory/entities,
  inventory/summary, and platforms/platform. The sensor-group and destination-group
  names differ but that is acceptable. The sample interval is correctly set to 120000
  ms (2 minutes). Due to the sensor-path mismatch, the score is low but not zero since
  the transport and addressing are correct.
