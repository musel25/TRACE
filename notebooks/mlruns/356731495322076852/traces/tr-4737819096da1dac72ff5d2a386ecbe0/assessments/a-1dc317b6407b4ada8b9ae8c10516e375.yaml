rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.124),
  and port (57500). The sample interval is set to 120 seconds (2 minutes), which matches
  the request. However, the sensor-path in the candidate config is 'platform-inventory/fru'
  which partially matches the request for platform inventory and hardware state (FRU
  inventory entities + operational status), but it does not include all expected sensor-paths
  such as 'inventory/entities', 'inventory/summary', and 'platforms/platform' as in
  the reference. The candidate also omits encoding specification and protocol details
  like 'encoding self-describing-gpb' and 'protocol grpc no-tls' explicitly, though
  'no-tls' is present. Naming differences and ordering are acceptable. Overall, the
  candidate meets the hard requirements but is incomplete in sensor-path coverage
  and encoding details, resulting in a moderate score.
