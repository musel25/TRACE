rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  192.0.2.124, and port 57500, and sets a 2-minute sample interval. The encoding self-describing-gpb
  is also correct. However, the sensor paths differ from the expected ones: candidate
  uses ''platform-inventory/fru'' and ''platform-hardware-state/fru-oper'' while the
  expectation is for ''inventory/entities'', ''inventory/summary'', and ''platforms/platform''.
  These sensor paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but are
  not the exact expected paths, which is a moderate mismatch. Naming and ordering
  differences are acceptable.'
