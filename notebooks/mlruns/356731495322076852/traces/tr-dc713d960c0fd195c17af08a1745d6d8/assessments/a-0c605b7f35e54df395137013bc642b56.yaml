rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port 57500,
  and encoding self-describing-gpb, matching the hard requirements. The sample interval
  is also close (120000 ms = 2 minutes). However, the sensor-paths differ significantly
  from the expected ones; the candidate uses telemetry-model-driven/platform-inventory/fru
  and fru/state, while the expectation is for inventory/entities, inventory/summary,
  and platforms/platform. These sensor-paths are related to platform inventory and
  hardware state but are not the same and may not fully meet the user's request for
  FRU inventory entities plus operational status. Therefore, a partial score is given
  due to correct transport and destination but differing sensor-paths.
