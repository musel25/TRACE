rationale: The candidate config matches the IP, port, transport (grpc no-tls), and
  encoding requirements. However, the sensor-paths are unrelated to the requested
  platform inventory and hardware state; instead, they reference telemetry-model-driven
  subscriptions state, which is incorrect. The sensor-group and destination-group
  names differ but that is acceptable. The sample interval is correctly set to 120000
  ms (2 minutes). Due to the incorrect sensor-paths, the configuration does not fulfill
  the core telemetry data requirements.
