rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and the sample interval is approximately 2 minutes
  (120000 ms). However, the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones;
  the candidate uses 'Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-oper' paths which are not
  aligned with the expected 'Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper' and 'Cisco-IOS-XR-platforms-ofa-oper'
  paths. The sensor paths in the candidate are related to platform inventory and hardware
  state but do not match the expected FRU inventory entities and operational status
  paths. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable, but the sensor paths are
  not clearly matching the expectations, so a moderate penalty is applied.
