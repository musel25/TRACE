rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no-tls, IP 192.0.2.124, port 57500,
  and a 2-minute sample interval, meeting the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths
  differ significantly from the expectations; the candidate uses 'platform-inventory
  / inventory-entity' and 'state/operational-status' while the expected config uses
  more specific Cisco IOS XR model paths related to platform inventory and hardware
  state. The candidate's sensor-paths are related but less specific and do not fully
  match the expected model-driven paths, leading to a moderate score.
