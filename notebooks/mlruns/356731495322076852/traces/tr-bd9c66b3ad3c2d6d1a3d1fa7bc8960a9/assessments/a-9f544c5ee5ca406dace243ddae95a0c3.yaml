rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 120000 ms (2 minutes),
  meeting the hard requirements. However, the sensor paths differ significantly from
  the expected ones; the candidate uses 'inventory/rp-entity/ent-physical-state' and
  related paths, while the expectation specifies Cisco IOS XR operational model paths
  like 'Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities' and others. The candidate's
  sensor paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but do not match
  the expected model-driven telemetry paths, which is a moderate mismatch. Naming
  and ordering differences are acceptable, but the sensor paths are not clearly aligned
  with the expected ones, leading to a partial penalty.
