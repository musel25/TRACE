rationale: The candidate config is a YANG module definition rather than an IOS XR
  CLI telemetry configuration. It specifies the server IP, port, and gRPC no-tls transport
  correctly, and the sample interval is approximately 2 minutes (120 seconds). However,
  it lacks the required sensor-paths related to platform inventory and hardware state
  as specified in the expectations. The sensor-paths in the candidate are generic
  and do not match the detailed sensor-paths in the reference config. Therefore, it
  meets some hard requirements (IP, port, transport) but fails on sensor-paths, resulting
  in a low score.
