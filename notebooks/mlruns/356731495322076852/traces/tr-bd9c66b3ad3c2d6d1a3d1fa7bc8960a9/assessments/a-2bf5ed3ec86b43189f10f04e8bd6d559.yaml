rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address
  (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and the encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the
  hard requirements. The sample interval is also set to 120000 ms (2 minutes), which
  matches the request. However, the sensor paths in the candidate config (inventory-rp:inventory/rp:rp/hardware-r:hardware/hardware-state
  and hardware-fru) are different from the expected sensor paths (Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities,
  inventory/summary, and Cisco-IOS-XR-platforms-ofa-oper:platforms/platform). These
  sensor paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but are not the
  same as the reference, indicating a partial mismatch. The sensor-group and destination-group
  names differ but that is acceptable. Due to the sensor-path mismatch, the score
  is reduced but not zero since the paths are related to the requested data.
