tr-bd9c66b3ad3c2d6d1a3d1fa7bc8960a9,,,,0.3,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct IP address (192.0.2.124), and port (57500), and the encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements. The sample interval is also set to 120000 ms (2 minutes), which matches the request. However, the sensor paths in the candidate config (inventory-rp:inventory/rp:rp/hardware-r:hardware/hardware-state and hardware-fru) are different from the expected sensor paths (Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities, inventory/summary, and Cisco-IOS-XR-platforms-ofa-oper:platforms/platform). These sensor paths are related to platform inventory and hardware state but are not the same as the reference, indicating a partial mismatch. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable. Due to the sensor-path mismatch, the score is reduced but not zero since the paths are related to the requested data."
tr-3eb13b9046685257bdd640fb06671ad1,,,,0.8,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.182), and port (57500), and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms as requested. The encoding is self-describing-gpb as expected. However, the sensor-paths differ from the reference; the candidate uses 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor/host-addresses/host-address' and 'ipv6-nd:ipv6-neighbor/ipv6-neighbor/interface-state' which are related to IPv6 neighbor discovery but do not match the more specific and fully qualified sensor-paths in the reference. The candidate's sensor-paths are not clearly unrelated but are less precise. Naming differences and ordering are acceptable. Overall, the config meets the hard requirements but the sensor-paths are somewhat imprecise compared to the reference."
