!",0.7,"The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.196), port (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), fulfilling the hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 600000 ms (10 minutes), which matches the request. However, the sensor-paths differ from the expectation: the candidate uses 'Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities/entity' and 'platform/slot-instances/slot-instance' while the expectation uses 'Cisco-IOS-XR-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities/entity' and 'Cisco-IOS-XR-platform-oper:platform/racks/rack/slots/slot/instances/instance/state'. The candidate's sensor-paths are related to hardware inventory and platform slot instance state but are not exactly the same and may represent different data models or hierarchy. The naming of sensor-group and destination-group differ but this is acceptable. Overall, the config meets the main requirements but the sensor-paths are not fully aligned with the reference, so a moderate score is given."
