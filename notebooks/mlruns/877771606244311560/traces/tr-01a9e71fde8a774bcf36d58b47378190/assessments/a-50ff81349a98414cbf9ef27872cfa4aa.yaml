rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.196), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). It includes
  sensor-paths related to inventory and platform slot instance state, though the exact
  sensor-paths differ from the reference, which uses more specific and fully qualified
  paths. The candidate's sensor-paths are related but less precise, which is acceptable
  but slightly penalized. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable. Sample interval
  matches the 10 minutes requirement.
