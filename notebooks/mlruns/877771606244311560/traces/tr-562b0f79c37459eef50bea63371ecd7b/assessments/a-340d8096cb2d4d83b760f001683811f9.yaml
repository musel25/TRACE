rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP, port, transport (grpc no-tls),
  and encoding as requested. However, the sensor-paths are unrelated to the user's
  request for hardware inventory and platform slot instance state; instead, it configures
  unrelated sensor-paths for hardware-module-port-mode. The destination group and
  subscription names differ but that is acceptable. The sample interval is close enough.
  Due to incorrect sensor-paths, the score is low despite correct transport and destination
  settings.
