rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). However, the
  sensor-paths used (ipv4-acl-oper:routes and ipv4-acl-oper:statistics) do not match
  the expected ipv4-acl-oper sensor paths related to ACL sequences and prefix lists.
  The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested. The naming and
  ordering differences are acceptable, but the sensor-paths are not aligned with the
  expected incident response telemetry data, which is a significant deviation.
