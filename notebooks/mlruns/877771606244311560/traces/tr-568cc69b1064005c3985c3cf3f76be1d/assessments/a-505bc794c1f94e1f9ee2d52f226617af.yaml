rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The
  sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested. However, the sensor-path
  in the candidate is less specific and does not include the detailed paths for ACL
  sequences and prefix lists as in the expectation, which are more aligned with the
  request for IPv4 ACL telemetry statistics. The sensor-group name and destination-group
  name differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the candidate meets the hard requirements
  but the sensor-paths are less precise and partially unrelated to the detailed expected
  paths.
