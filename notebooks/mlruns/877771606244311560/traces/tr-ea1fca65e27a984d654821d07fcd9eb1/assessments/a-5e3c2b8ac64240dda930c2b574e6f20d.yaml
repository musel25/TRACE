rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP address
  192.0.2.187, and port 57500, and sets the sample interval to 30000 ms as requested.
  However, the sensor-path used (/Cisco-IOS-XR-fia-hw-profile-cfg:ipv4-acl-oper/ipv4-acl-table)
  is unrelated to the expected ipv4-acl-oper sensor paths for ACL telemetry statistics.
  The sensor-group name and destination-group name differ but that is acceptable.
  The main issue is the sensor-paths do not match the expected ACL telemetry data,
  which is critical for incident response telemetry.
