rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, IP 192.0.2.196, port
  57500, and encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements. However,
  the sensor-paths differ: candidate includes broader inventory and SDR inventory
  paths, while the expectation specifies precise hardware inventory entities and platform
  slot instance state paths. The candidate''s sensor-paths are related but not exactly
  matching the requested hardware inventory/state streams, leading to a partial match.
  Naming and ordering differences are acceptable.'
