rationale: 'The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.196), port (57500),
  transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), meeting the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor paths differ significantly: the candidate includes many detailed
  inventory paths but does not include the platform slot instance state sensor path
  as requested. The reference expects two specific sensor paths: inventory entities
  and platform slot instance state, while the candidate only covers inventory-related
  paths extensively. Sample interval is acceptable (600000 ms = 10 minutes). The naming
  and ordering differences are acceptable. Overall, the candidate partially fulfills
  the request but misses the platform slot instance state sensor path, leading to
  a moderate score.'
