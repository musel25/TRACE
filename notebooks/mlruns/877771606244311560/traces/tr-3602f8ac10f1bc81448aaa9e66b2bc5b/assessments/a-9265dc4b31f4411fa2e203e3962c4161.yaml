rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which
  are hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested.
  However, the sensor-path used (ipv4-acl-oper/acl-statistics) is different and less
  specific than the expected detailed sensor-paths related to ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list.
  The candidate's sensor-path is related to IPv4 ACL telemetry but not as detailed
  or matching the expected paths, which slightly reduces the score. Naming and ordering
  differences are acceptable.
