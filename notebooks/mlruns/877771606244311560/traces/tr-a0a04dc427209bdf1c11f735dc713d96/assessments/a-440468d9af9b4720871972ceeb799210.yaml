rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.196), port (57500), transport
  (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), meeting the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor paths are overly detailed and do not match the expected sensor
  paths for hardware inventory and platform slot instance state. The candidate includes
  many nested sensor paths unrelated to the requested platform slot instance state.
  The subscription and destination group names differ but that is acceptable. Overall,
  the config partially meets the requirements but the sensor paths are not aligned
  with the request.
