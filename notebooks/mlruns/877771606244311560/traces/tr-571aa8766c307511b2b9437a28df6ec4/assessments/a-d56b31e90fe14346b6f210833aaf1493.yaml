rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), meeting
  the hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested.
  However, the sensor-path used (ipv4-acl-oper/acl-statistics) is different from the
  expected detailed sensor paths related to ipv4-acl-oper with access-list sequences
  and prefix lists. While related to IPv4 ACL telemetry, the sensor-path is less specific
  and may not fully capture the intended data. Naming and ordering differences are
  acceptable.
