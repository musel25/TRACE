rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.196),
  and port (57500), and the encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones: the candidate
  uses ''inventory/entitlements/entity'' and ''inventory/platform/slot/state'' which
  are not clearly related to the expected ''Cisco-IOS-XR-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities/entity''
  and ''Cisco-IOS-XR-platform-oper:platform/racks/rack/slots/slot/instances/instance/state''.
  The candidate''s sensor-paths are less specific and may not capture the requested
  hardware inventory/state data accurately. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable,
  but the sensor-path mismatch reduces the score.'
