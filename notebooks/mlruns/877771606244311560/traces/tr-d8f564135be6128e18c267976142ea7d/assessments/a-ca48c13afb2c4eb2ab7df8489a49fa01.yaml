rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), fulfilling
  the hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested.
  However, the sensor-path in the candidate config differs from the expected sensor-paths;
  it uses 'Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-oper:acl/acl-sets/acl-set/acl-entries/acl-entry/statistics'
  instead of the expected 'ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list/access-list-manager/accesses/access/access-list-sequences/access-list-sequence'
  and 'prefix-list-manager/prefixes/prefix'. While related to IPv4 ACL telemetry,
  the sensor-paths are not the same and may represent different data. The candidate
  config also uses different sensor-group and destination-group names, which is acceptable.
  Overall, the config meets the main transport and destination requirements but partially
  misses the exact sensor-paths requested, resulting in a moderate score.
