rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), meeting the
  hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds), as requested.
  However, the sensor-path in the candidate is less specific and does not include
  the detailed paths for access-list-sequences and prefix-list as in the expectation.
  The sensor-group name and destination-group name differ but that is acceptable.
  Overall, the config is mostly correct but the sensor-paths are less detailed than
  expected, leading to a moderate penalty.
