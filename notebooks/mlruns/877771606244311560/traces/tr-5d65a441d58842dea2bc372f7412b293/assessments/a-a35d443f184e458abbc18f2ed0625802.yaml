rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.196),
  and port (57500), and the encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements.
  The sample interval is set to 600000 ms (10 minutes), which matches the request.
  However, the sensor-paths differ from the expected ones: the candidate uses Cisco-IOS-XR-sdr-inventory-vm-oper
  paths, while the expectation uses Cisco-IOS-XR-invmgr-oper and Cisco-IOS-XR-platform-oper
  paths. These are related to hardware inventory and platform slot instance state
  but are not the exact expected paths. The naming of sensor-groups and destination-groups
  differs but is acceptable. Overall, the config is mostly correct but with some deviation
  in sensor-paths.'
