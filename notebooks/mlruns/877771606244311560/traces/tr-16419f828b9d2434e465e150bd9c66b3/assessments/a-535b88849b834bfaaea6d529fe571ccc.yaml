rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which
  are hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds), matching
  the request. However, the sensor-path used (ipv4-acl-oper/statistics) is less specific
  and does not match the detailed sensor paths in the expectation (which include Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-oper:ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list/...
  paths). The candidate's sensor-path is related to IPv4 ACL telemetry but is more
  generic and may not capture the exact data requested. Naming and ordering differences
  are acceptable. Overall, the config meets the transport and destination requirements
  but partially matches the sensor-path expectations, resulting in a moderate score.
