rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), meeting
  the hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested.
  However, the sensor-path used (ipv4-acl-oper/statistics) is less specific and does
  not match the detailed sensor paths in the expectation, which include specific Cisco-IOS-XR
  IPv4 ACL operational paths. The candidate's sensor-path is related but less precise,
  so it partially meets the requirement. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable.
