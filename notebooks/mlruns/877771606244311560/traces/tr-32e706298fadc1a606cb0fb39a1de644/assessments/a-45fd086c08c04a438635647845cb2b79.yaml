rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample
  interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested. However, the sensor-path
  used in the candidate config (Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-oper:acl/acl-sets/acl-set/acl-entries/acl-entry/statistics)
  differs from the expected sensor-paths related to ipv4-acl-oper with access-list-manager
  and prefix-list-manager. While both relate to IPv4 ACL telemetry, the candidate's
  sensor-path is not clearly aligned with the expected paths and may not capture the
  exact intended data. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable. Overall, the
  config meets transport and destination requirements but partially diverges on sensor-path
  relevance.
