rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), meeting the
  hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested.
  However, the sensor-path in the candidate is less specific and does not include
  the detailed sub-paths for access-list sequences and prefix lists as in the expectation.
  The sensor-path used is related but less granular, which is acceptable but slightly
  less precise. Overall, the config is functional and mostly aligned with the request
  but could be improved by including the more detailed sensor-paths.
