rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.187), port (57500), transport
  (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which meets the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate
  uses many detailed sensor-paths under ipv4-acl-oper:ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list, while
  the expectation references broader paths including access-list-manager and prefix-list-manager.
  The sample-interval is correctly set to 30000 ms (30 seconds). The naming and ordering
  differences are acceptable, but the sensor-paths are not closely aligned with the
  reference, so the score is low but not zero due to correct transport and destination
  settings.
