rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample
  interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested. However, the sensor-path
  in the candidate is less specific and does not include the detailed paths for access-list-sequences
  and prefix-list-sequence as in the expectation. The sensor-group name and destination-group
  name differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the config meets the hard requirements
  but the sensor-paths are less detailed and partially unrelated to the expected detailed
  ACL telemetry paths, so a moderate penalty is applied.
