rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), meeting the
  hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested.
  However, the sensor-path used (ipv4-acl-oper/acl-statistics) is different and less
  specific than the expected detailed sensor-paths related to ipv4-acl-oper with access-list
  sequences and prefix lists. The candidate's sensor-path is related to IPv4 ACL telemetry
  but less detailed and may not fully capture the requested data. Naming and ordering
  differences are acceptable. Overall, the config is mostly correct but the sensor-paths
  are not fully aligned with expectations.
