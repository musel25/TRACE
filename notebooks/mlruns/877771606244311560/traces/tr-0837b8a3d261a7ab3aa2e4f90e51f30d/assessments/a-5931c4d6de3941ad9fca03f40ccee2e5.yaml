rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, IP 192.0.2.196, port
  57500, and self-describing-gpb encoding, meeting the hard requirements. However,
  the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones: candidate includes
  broader inventory and sdr-inventory paths, while the expectation specifies precise
  inventory entities and platform slot instance state paths. The destination group
  naming and structure also differ, but this is less critical. Overall, the config
  is mostly correct but sensor-paths are not closely aligned with the request, warranting
  a moderate score.'
