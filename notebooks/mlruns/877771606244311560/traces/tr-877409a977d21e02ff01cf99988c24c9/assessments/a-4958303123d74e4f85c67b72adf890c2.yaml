rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.196), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), fulfilling
  the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected
  ones; the candidate's sensor-paths are more complex and do not clearly match the
  requested hardware inventory and platform slot instance state paths. The naming
  and ordering differences are acceptable, but the sensor-paths are not clearly aligned
  with the request, leading to a moderate penalty.
