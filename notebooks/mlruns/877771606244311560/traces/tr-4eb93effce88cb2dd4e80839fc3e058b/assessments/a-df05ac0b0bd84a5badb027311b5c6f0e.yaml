rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP address
  192.0.2.187, and port 57500, and sets sample-interval to 30000 ms (30 seconds),
  which meets the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths used (ipv4-acl-oper:routes
  and ipv4-acl-oper:statistics) do not match the expected sensor-paths related to
  ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list and access-list-sequence, which are more relevant to IPv4
  ACL telemetry statistics. The candidate's sensor-paths appear unrelated to the requested
  ipv4-acl-oper sensor paths for incident response. The naming and ordering differences
  are acceptable, but the sensor-path mismatch is significant, leading to a low score.
