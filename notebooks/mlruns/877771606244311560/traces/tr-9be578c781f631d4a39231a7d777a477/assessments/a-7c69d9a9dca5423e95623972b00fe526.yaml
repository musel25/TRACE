rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP address
  192.0.2.187, and port 57500, and sets sample-interval to 30000 (30 seconds), which
  meets the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths used (ipv4-acl-oper:routes
  and ipv4-acl-oper:statistics) do not match the expected ipv4-acl-oper sensor paths
  related to ACL sequences and prefix lists. The sensor-paths are related to IPv4
  ACL telemetry but are not aligned with the expected detailed ACL operational data.
  The naming and ordering differences are acceptable, but the sensor-paths are not
  clearly matching the expected ones, so the score is low but not zero due to correct
  transport and addressing.
