rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.196), port (57500), transport
  (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which meets the hard requirements.
  However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate
  uses Cisco-IOS-XR-cmproxy-oper paths instead of Cisco-IOS-XR-invmgr-oper and Cisco-IOS-XR-platform-oper
  paths as requested. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that
  is acceptable. The sample interval is correctly set to 600000 ms (10 minutes). Due
  to the sensor-path mismatch, the score is low despite correct transport and addressing.
