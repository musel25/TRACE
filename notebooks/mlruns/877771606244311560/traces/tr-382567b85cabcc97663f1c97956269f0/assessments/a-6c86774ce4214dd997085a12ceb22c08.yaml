rationale: The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.196),
  port (57500), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample interval is approximately
  10 minutes (600000 ms). However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the
  expected ones; the candidate uses more complex and nested paths that do not clearly
  match the expected inventory and platform slot instance state paths. The destination
  group name differs but that is acceptable. Overall, the key transport and destination
  parameters are correct, but the sensor-paths are not clearly aligned with the request,
  leading to a moderate score.
