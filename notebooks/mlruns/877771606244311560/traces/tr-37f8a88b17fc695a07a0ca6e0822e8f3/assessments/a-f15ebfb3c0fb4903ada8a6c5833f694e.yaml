rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.196), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), fulfilling
  the hard requirements. The sample interval is set to 600000 ms (10 minutes), which
  matches the request. However, the sensor-paths differ from the expectation: the
  candidate uses ''Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities/entity''
  and ''platform/slot-instances/slot-instance'' while the expectation uses ''Cisco-IOS-XR-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities/entity''
  and ''Cisco-IOS-XR-platform-oper:platform/racks/rack/slots/slot/instances/instance/state''.
  The candidate''s sensor-paths are related to hardware inventory and platform slot
  instance state but are not exactly the same and may represent different data models
  or hierarchy. The naming of sensor-group and destination-group differ but this is
  acceptable. Overall, the config meets the main requirements but the sensor-paths
  are not fully aligned with the reference, so a moderate score is given.'
