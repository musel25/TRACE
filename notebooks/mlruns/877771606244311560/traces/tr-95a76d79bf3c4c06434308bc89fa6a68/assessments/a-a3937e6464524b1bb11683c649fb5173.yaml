rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.187), port (57500), and
  transport protocol (grpc no-tls) as requested. The sample interval is set to 30000
  ms (30 seconds), which matches the request. However, the sensor paths differ significantly
  from the expected ones; the candidate uses many detailed sensor paths under ipv4-acl-oper:ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list,
  but the expected config uses broader paths including access-list-manager and prefix-list-manager.
  The candidate's sensor paths are related to IPv4 ACL telemetry but are not aligned
  with the expected sensor paths, which is a partial mismatch. Naming and ordering
  differences are acceptable. Overall, the candidate meets the hard requirements but
  the sensor paths are not closely aligned, resulting in a low to moderate score.
