rationale: 'The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.196), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample
  interval is approximately 10 minutes (600000 ms). However, the sensor-paths differ
  from the reference: candidate uses ''inventory/entities'' and ''platform/slot/instance/state''
  without the full YANG model prefixes and more detailed paths as in the reference.
  The sensor-paths are related but less specific, which is acceptable but not ideal.
  Naming and ordering differences are acceptable.'
