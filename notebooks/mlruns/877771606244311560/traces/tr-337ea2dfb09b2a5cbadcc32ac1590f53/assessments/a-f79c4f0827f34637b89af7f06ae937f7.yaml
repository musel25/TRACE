rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The
  sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested. However, the sensor-path
  in the candidate is less specific and does not include the detailed paths for access-list-sequences
  and prefix-list as in the expectation, which are more aligned with the user's request
  for IPv4 ACL telemetry statistics. The sensor-group name and destination-group name
  differ but that is acceptable. Overall, the config meets the hard requirements but
  the sensor-paths are less precise, so a moderate penalty is applied.
