rationale: The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.187), port (57500), and
  transport protocol (grpc no-tls) as requested, which meets the hard requirements.
  The sample interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds), matching the request. However,
  the sensor paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses
  many detailed sensor paths under ipv4-acl-oper:ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list, while the
  expectation references broader paths including access-list-manager and prefix-list-manager.
  The candidate's sensor paths are related to IPv4 ACL telemetry but are more granular
  and not exactly aligned with the expected sensor paths. Naming and ordering differences
  are acceptable, but the sensor paths should be clearly related. Overall, the candidate
  partially fulfills the request but deviates in sensor-path selection, resulting
  in a moderate score.
