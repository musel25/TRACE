rationale: The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.187), port
  (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample
  interval is set to 30000 ms (30 seconds) as requested. However, the sensor-path
  in the candidate is less specific and does not include the detailed paths for ACL
  sequences and prefix lists as in the expectation, which are more aligned with incident
  response telemetry. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that
  is acceptable. Overall, the config meets the hard requirements but the sensor-paths
  are somewhat less precise than expected.
