!",0.6,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, IP 192.0.2.196, port 57500, and self-describing-gpb encoding, meeting the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones: candidate includes broader inventory and sdr-inventory paths, while the expectation specifies precise inventory entities and platform slot instance state paths. The destination group naming and structure also differ, but this is less critical. Overall, the config is mostly correct but sensor-paths are not closely aligned with the request, warranting a moderate score."
