!",0.7,"The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.196), port (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample interval is approximately 10 minutes (600000 ms). However, the sensor-paths differ from the reference: candidate uses 'inventory/entities' and 'platform/slot/instance/state' without the full YANG model prefixes and more detailed paths as in the reference. The sensor-paths are related but less specific, which is acceptable but not ideal. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable."
