!",0.6,"The candidate config correctly uses the specified IP (192.0.2.196), port (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), fulfilling the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate's sensor-paths are more complex and do not clearly match the requested hardware inventory and platform slot instance state paths. The naming and ordering differences are acceptable, but the sensor-paths are not clearly aligned with the request, leading to a moderate penalty."
