!",0.6,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.196), port (57500), and encoding (self-describing-gpb). The sample interval is approximately 10 minutes (600000 ms). However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses more complex and nested paths that do not clearly match the expected inventory and platform slot instance state paths. The destination group name differs but that is acceptable. Overall, the key transport and destination parameters are correct, but the sensor-paths are not clearly aligned with the request, leading to a moderate score."
