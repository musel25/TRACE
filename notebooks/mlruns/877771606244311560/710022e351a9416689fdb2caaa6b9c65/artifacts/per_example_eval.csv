!",0.6,"The candidate config correctly uses gRPC no TLS, the correct IP (192.0.2.196), and port (57500), and the encoding self-describing-gpb, meeting the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones: the candidate uses 'inventory/entitlements/entity' and 'inventory/platform/slot/state' which are not clearly related to the expected 'Cisco-IOS-XR-invmgr-oper:inventory/entities/entity' and 'Cisco-IOS-XR-platform-oper:platform/racks/rack/slots/slot/instances/instance/state'. The candidate's sensor-paths are less specific and may not capture the requested hardware inventory/state data accurately. Naming and ordering differences are acceptable, but the sensor-path mismatch reduces the score."
