!",0.3,"The candidate config uses the correct IP (192.0.2.196), port (57500), transport (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb), which meets the hard requirements. However, the sensor-paths differ significantly from the expected ones; the candidate uses Cisco-IOS-XR-cmproxy-oper paths instead of Cisco-IOS-XR-invmgr-oper and Cisco-IOS-XR-platform-oper paths as requested. The sensor-group and destination-group names differ but that is acceptable. The sample interval is correctly set to 600000 ms (10 minutes). Due to the sensor-path mismatch, the score is low despite correct transport and addressing."
