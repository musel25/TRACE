rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for L2VPN xconnect
  and pseudowire operational state, using gRPC no TLS to the specified server IP and
  port, matching the user's request. The sensor-paths are relevant to L2VPN xconnect
  and pseudowire state, though the output uses slightly different sensor-paths (l2vpn/xconnects
  and l2vpn/pseudowires) compared to the reference (l2vpnv2/active/xconnects and l2vpnv2/active/pseudowires).
  This difference is acceptable as both are relevant to the requested feature. The
  sample-interval differs (30000 vs 60000) but this is not penalized. The destination-group
  and sensor-group names differ but this is allowed. Overall, the output meets the
  core requirements well, so a high score is justified.
