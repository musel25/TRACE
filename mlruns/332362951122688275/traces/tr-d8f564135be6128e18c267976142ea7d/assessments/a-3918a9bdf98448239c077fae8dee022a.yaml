rationale: 'The model output and the expected response differ in several key aspects.
  The model uses sensor groups named ''LACP-ETHCHANNEL-OPR'' with sensor-paths specifically
  ''Cisco-IOS-XR-lacp-oper:lacp/bundles/bundle'', ''lacp/members/member'', and ''lacp/counters''
  which aligns partially with the user''s prompt for LACP/EtherChannel operational
  monitoring including bundles, members, and counters. However, the expected response
  references additional and different sensor-paths: ''Cisco-IOS-XR-bundlemgr-oper:bundle-information'',
  ''Cisco-IOS-XR-lacp-oper:lacp/nodes/node/bundles'', and ''lacp/nodes/node/interfaces''
  which arguably provide more granular per-node and interface-level telemetry data
  relevant to LACP and bundling. Also, the destination group names differ (''DG-GRPC''
  vs ''DG-LACP'') and the subscription names differ (''SUB-LACP-ETHCHANNEL'' vs ''SUB-LACP'').
  While these namings may be cosmetic, the sensor-paths differ meaningfully. The prompt
  instructs to choose relevant sensor-paths for LACP/EtherChannel operational monitoring,
  and the expected response includes sensor-paths that incorporate node and interface
  hierarchy consistent with operational telemetry best practices in IOS XR. Further,
  the presence of ''counters'' in the model output is relevant but not present in
  the expected response. Overall, the model output is not functionally equivalent
  as it omits some relevant sensor-paths and sensor groups, and includes different
  paths that may not fully cover the requested monitoring scope. Therefore, the model
  output is not acceptable based on the provided expectations.'
