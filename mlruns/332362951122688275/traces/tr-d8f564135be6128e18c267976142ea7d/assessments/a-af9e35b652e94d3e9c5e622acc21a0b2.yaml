rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for LACP/EtherChannel
  operational monitoring using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server
  IP and port, matching the user's request. The sensor-paths are relevant and cover
  bundles, members, and counters, which align well with the requested monitoring data,
  though they differ slightly from the reference paths. The destination group and
  subscription names differ but this is acceptable. The encoding and protocol match
  the user request exactly. Overall, the configuration meets the user's requirements
  with only minor differences in sensor-path specifics and naming, so a high score
  is justified.
