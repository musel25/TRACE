rationale: The model output does not match the expected configuration in critical
  aspects. The expected response configures a sensor-group named ISIS-STATS with sensor-path
  targeting ipv4-routes, uses a TCP protocol without TLS, encodes data in JSON, and
  defines a destination-group named DG-ISIS specifying both address-family and destination
  details inline. The model output instead defines a sensor-group named ISIS-STATE
  with different sensor-paths related to igp-information and isis-nsr-infra, uses
  gRPC protocol with no TLS, encoding as self-describing-gpb, and a different destination-group
  DG-GRPC. Additionally, the model output specifies protocol grpc instead of tcp and
  encoding self-describing-gpb instead of json. The names of sensor groups, sensor-paths,
  protocols, encodings, and destination groups do not align. These differences imply
  that the model output is not functionally equivalent to the expected configuration
  and would not meet the user's request as stated.
