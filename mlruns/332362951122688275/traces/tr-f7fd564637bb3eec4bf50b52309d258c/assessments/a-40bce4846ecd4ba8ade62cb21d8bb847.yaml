rationale: 'The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for IOS XR 7.0.1
  with gRPC no TLS to the specified server IP and port, matching the user''s request.
  The destination IP (192.0.2.111), port (57500), protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding
  (self-describing-gpb) are all correct. The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to RIB
  summary and route counters for both IPv4 and IPv6, which aligns well with the user''s
  request for routing information base summary and route counters. The sample-interval
  differs (30000 ms vs 60000 ms in reference), but this is not penalized as per instructions.
  The main difference is in the sensor-group and sensor-path namespaces: the output
  uses Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-rib-ipv4-oper and Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-rib-ipv6-oper with paths
  like rib-summary and route-counts, while the reference uses Cisco-IOS-XR-rib-oper
  with vrfs and summary paths. Both approaches are valid for RIB data, but the output''s
  sensor-paths are more explicitly about rib-summary and route-counts, which matches
  the user''s request for RIB summary and route counters. Overall, the output satisfies
  the user request well, with minor differences in sensor-group naming and paths that
  do not reduce relevance. Hence, a high score of 0.8 is appropriate.'
