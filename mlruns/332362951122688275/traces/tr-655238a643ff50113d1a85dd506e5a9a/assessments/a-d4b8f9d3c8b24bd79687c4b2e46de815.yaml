rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for VRF operational
  monitoring using gRPC no TLS to the specified server IP and port, matching the user's
  request. The protocol, destination IP, and port are accurate. The encoding is self-describing-gpb,
  which is acceptable. The sensor-paths in the output are relevant to VRF state and
  route-targets, though they use the configuration data model (Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-rsi-cfg)
  instead of the operational data model (Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-rsi-oper) as in the reference.
  This is a minor difference but the user requested operational monitoring, so operational
  paths would be more appropriate. The sample-interval differs but this is not penalized
  unless explicitly requested. Naming differences in groups and subscriptions are
  not penalized. Overall, the output meets the core user requirements but could be
  improved by using operational sensor-paths for VRF state and route-targets.
