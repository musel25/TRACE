rationale: 'The model output includes a detailed telemetry model-driven configuration
  with a sensor-group named ''OPTICS-PROTOCOL'' containing multiple sensor-paths specific
  to optics telemetry, a destination-group ''DG-GRPC'' with address, port, encoding,
  and protocol matching the prompt, and a subscription linking the sensor-group and
  destination-group. The expected response, however, specifies a sensor-group ''Optics-STATS''
  with a single, more general sensor-path ''optics-info'', a subscription named ''SUB-Optics''
  with a longer sample-interval of 120000 milliseconds, and a destination-group ''DG-Optics''
  with the server details presented in a more compact syntax.


  Differences noted:

  - Sensor-group name and content differ, with the model output being more detailed
  but differing in naming and paths.

  - Subscription sample-intervals differ (30000 vs 120000).

  - Destination-group names differ (''DG-GRPC'' vs ''DG-Optics'').

  - The structure of the destination-group differs; the expected response specifies
  address-family ipv4 with IP and port in one line, while the model output splits
  these.


  Though functionally similar in targeting the same server with gRPC no-tls and self-describing-gpb
  encoding and telemetry of optics data, the model output differs significantly in
  sensor-group naming and subscription parameters, which affects functional equivalence.
  Also, the expected response uses a higher sample interval, which is part of telemetry
  config behavior.


  Therefore, the model output is not functionally equivalent to the expected configuration
  and is not acceptable.'
