rationale: 'The model output does not match the expectations in several key areas.
  1) Sensor-paths: The model uses ''Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-ospf-cfg:ospf'', which is a
  configuration path, while the expected response uses operational data paths such
  as ''Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-ospf-oper:ospf/processes/process/vrfs/vrf/database'' and
  ''.../areas''. These represent different data and have different intents; monitoring
  OSPF operational state is generally more useful in telemetry than configuration
  data. 2) Destination-group naming: The model uses ''DG-GRPC'' and protocol as ''grpc
  no-tls'', while the expected uses ''DG-OSPF'' with protocol ''tcp'' as requested
  by the user. The user''s prompt specified protocol tcp, but the model incorrectly
  sets ''grpc no-tls''. 3) The model groups destination and subscription, but the
  expected response separates destination-group into its own section and includes
  the proper address-family syntax with port, encoding, and protocol. 4) The sample-interval
  of 30000 is consistent in both. 5) Overall the intent relevant sensor-paths (operational
  OSPF data) and destination details are important and missing or incorrect in the
  model output. Because of these substantial deviations in critical fields, the model
  output is not functionally equivalent or acceptable compared to the expected response.'
