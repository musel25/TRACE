rationale: The model output is not functionally equivalent to the expected response.
  The expected configuration includes sensor paths for both IGMP ('Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-igmp-oper:igmp/active')
  and PIM multicast operational data ('Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-pim-oper:pim/active' and
  interfaces), while the model output only includes various PIM sensor paths and an
  XTC agent path that is not part of the expected configuration. Furthermore, the
  sensor group name differs ('MULTICAST-OPERATIONAL' vs 'MCAST-OPER'), the destination
  group name differs ('DG-GRPC' vs 'DG-MCAST'), and the sample interval in subscription
  differs (30000 ms vs 60000 ms). Also, the model output uses nested sensor-paths
  including 'interface-statistic' and 'p2mp-policies', which are not in the expectations.
  These differences affect the intent-relevant sensor-paths and overall functional
  equivalence, so the output is not acceptable.
