rationale: The output correctly configures telemetry for multicast operational monitoring
  using gRPC no-tls to the specified server IP and port, matching the user's request.
  The destination IP (192.0.2.116), port (57500), protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding
  (self-describing-gpb) are all correct. The sensor-paths are relevant to multicast
  PIM operational data, including interface statistics and PIM information, which
  aligns with the user's request for PIM/IGMP neighbors, groups, and interfaces monitoring.
  However, the output does not include explicit IGMP sensor-paths as in the reference,
  and the sample-interval differs (30000 ms vs 60000 ms), which is acceptable since
  the user did not specify interval. The naming of groups and subscriptions differs
  but is not penalized. Overall, the output satisfies the user request well with minor
  differences in sensor-path coverage and sample interval, resulting in a good but
  not perfect score.
