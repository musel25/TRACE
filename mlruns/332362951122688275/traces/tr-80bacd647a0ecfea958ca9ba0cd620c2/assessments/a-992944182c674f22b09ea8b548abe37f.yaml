rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for ACL operational
  counters using gRPC with no TLS to the specified server IP and port, matching the
  user's request. The destination IP (192.0.2.114), port (57500), protocol (grpc no-tls),
  and encoding (self-describing-gpb) are all correct. The sensor-paths chosen are
  relevant to ACL operational counters, including ACL entries and interface bindings,
  which aligns well with the user's request for hit counts per ACE and interface bindings.
  The sample interval differs (30000 ms vs 60000 ms in the reference), but this is
  not penalized as the user did not specify it. The naming of groups and subscriptions
  differs but is not penalized. Overall, the configuration meets the user's requirements
  accurately and is a valid alternative to the reference.
