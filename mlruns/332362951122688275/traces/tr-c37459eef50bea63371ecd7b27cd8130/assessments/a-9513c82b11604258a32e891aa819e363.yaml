rationale: 'The model output does not meet the user''s request or the expected configuration
  for several reasons. First, the sensor-group and sensor-path in the model output
  are unrelated to the requested ''Interface protocol''; the model output uses ''INTERFACE''
  with a sensor-path for telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven/subscriptions/subscription/subscription/source-interface,
  whereas the expected config uses ''Interface-STATS'' with a sensor-path for Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper:infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters,
  which is more relevant and accurate for interface protocol telemetry.


  Second, the destination group in the model output is ''DG-GRPC'' with protocol grpc
  no-tls and encoding self-describing-gpb, while the user requested tcp protocol and
  json encoding, and the expected config matches this specification with protocol
  tcp and encoding json.


  Third, the destination address and port are configured in a different structure
  and incorrectly in the model output relative to the expected configuration.


  Overall, the model output is neither structurally nor functionally equivalent to
  the expected configuration, does not match the requested protocol, encoding, or
  sensor-paths, and is thus not acceptable.'
