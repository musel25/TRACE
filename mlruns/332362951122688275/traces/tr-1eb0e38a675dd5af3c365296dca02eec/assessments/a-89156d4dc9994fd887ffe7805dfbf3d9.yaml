rationale: The output correctly configures telemetry model-driven for NetFlow operational
  statistics with relevant sensor-paths for exporter, cache, and drops, which are
  appropriate for monitoring NetFlow flow monitor operational stats as requested.
  The destination IP (192.0.2.115), port (57500), protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding
  (self-describing-gpb) match the user request exactly. The sample-interval differs
  (30000 vs 60000) but this is not penalized. The sensor-group and subscription names
  differ but this is allowed. The sensor-paths used are from Cisco-IOS-XR-dnx-netflow-oper,
  which is a valid and relevant module for NetFlow operational data, though different
  from the reference which uses Cisco-IOS-XR-netflow-oper and Cisco-IOS-XR-flowspec-oper.
  Overall, the configuration meets the user request well with only minor differences
  from the reference, so a high score is justified.
