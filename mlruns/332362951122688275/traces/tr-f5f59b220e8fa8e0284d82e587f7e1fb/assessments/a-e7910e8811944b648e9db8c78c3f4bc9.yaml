rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for CPU and memory
  utilization using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server and port, matching
  the user's request. The destination IP, port, protocol, and encoding are all correct.
  The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to CPU and memory utilization, though they
  differ from the reference by using more generic paths (/system-monitoring/cpu-utilization
  and /memory) rather than the more specific Cisco IOS XR operational paths with namespaces.
  This difference is acceptable as the user did not specify exact sensor-paths, and
  the chosen paths are relevant. The sample-interval is not explicitly requested,
  so the default 30000 ms is acceptable. Overall, the configuration meets the user's
  requirements with minor differences in sensor-path specificity, resulting in a high
  but not perfect score.
