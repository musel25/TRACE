rationale: The output correctly configures telemetry for multicast operational monitoring
  focusing on PIM neighbors, groups, and interfaces, which aligns well with the user's
  request. It uses gRPC with no TLS, the correct server IP (192.0.2.116), and port
  (57500), matching the user specifications exactly. The encoding is self-describing-gpb
  as expected. The sensor-paths are relevant and specific to PIM multicast operational
  data, though the user also requested IGMP monitoring which is missing in the output.
  The sample-interval differs (30000 ms vs 60000 ms) but this is not penalized as
  per instructions. Naming differences in groups and subscriptions are not penalized.
  Overall, the output meets most of the user requirements with minor omissions, resulting
  in a high but not perfect score.
