rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for L2VPN xconnect/pseudowire
  operational state using gRPC with no TLS to the specified server address and port,
  matching the user's explicit requirements. The destination IP (192.0.2.110), port
  (57500), protocol (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb) are all correct
  as requested. The sensor-paths chosen are relevant and detailed, focusing on pseudowire
  remote-signalling TLVs within xconnect segments, which is appropriate for monitoring
  L2VPN xconnect/pseudowire operational state. The sample-interval differs from the
  reference but is not penalized as the user did not specify it. Minor differences
  in sensor-group and subscription names, as well as sensor-path granularity, are
  acceptable. Overall, the configuration meets the user request well with only minor
  deviations from the reference.
