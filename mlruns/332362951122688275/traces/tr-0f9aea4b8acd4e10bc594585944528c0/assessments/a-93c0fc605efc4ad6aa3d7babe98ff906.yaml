rationale: 'The model output does not match the expected response in several key aspects.
  The sensor group and sensor paths are different: the model uses ''ISIS-IS-IS-INTERMEDIATE-SYSTEMS''
  with a sensor path for intermediate systems, whereas the expectation is ''ISIS-STATS''
  with a sensor path for interfaces. The destination group names differ (''DG-GRPC''
  vs. ''DG-ISIS''). The protocol and encoding are different: the model uses gRPC protocol
  over TCP with ''self-describing-gpb'' encoding and no TLS, but the expectation specifies
  TCP protocol with ''json'' encoding. The subscription sample intervals differ significantly
  (30000 ms vs. 60000 ms). Also, the expected destination-group syntax differs, including
  the inclusion of destination IP and port within ''address-family ipv4'' in a different
  format. Overall, the model output is not functionally equivalent to the reference
  and does not meet the user request as per the expectations provided.'
