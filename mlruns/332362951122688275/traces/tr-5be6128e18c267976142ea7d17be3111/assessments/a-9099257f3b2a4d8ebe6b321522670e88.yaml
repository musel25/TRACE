rationale: 'The model output and the expected response differ significantly in key
  aspects. The model output configures a sensor-group named EVPN-TEPS with the sensor-path
  evpn/standby/teps, uses gRPC protocol with ''self-describing-gpb'' encoding and
  ''no-tls'', and the destination group is named DG-GRPC. The subscription and destination
  group references align with these names and configurations.


  The expected response, however, configures sensor-group EVPN-STATS with sensor-path
  Cisco-IOS-XR-evpn-oper:evpn/nodes/node/evi-detail, uses TCP protocol with ''json''
  encoding, and the destination group is DG-EVPN. The subscription and destination
  group are named accordingly.


  Additionally, the expected sensor-path, encoding, protocol, and naming conventions
  differ from the model output. The user request specified TCP protocol, sample interval
  30000ms, server 10.10.10.10:57000, and EVPN telemetry. The model output uses grpc
  protocol with no-tls and self-describing-gpb encoding, which does not match the
  user requested TCP.


  Therefore, the model output is not functionally equivalent to the expected configuration
  and does not meet the user''s request precisely.'
