rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for IOS XR 7.0.1
  with gRPC no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port, matching the user's
  request. The protocol, encoding, and destination details are accurate. The sensor-paths
  chosen relate to IPv4 and IPv6 RIB data, which aligns with the user's request for
  routing information base summary and route counters, though the exact sensor-paths
  differ from the reference. The sample interval differs but is not penalized as the
  user did not specify it. Overall, the configuration meets the core requirements
  with minor differences in sensor-path naming and structure, which is acceptable.
