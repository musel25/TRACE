rationale: The output uses gRPC no-tls and the correct server IP and port as requested,
  which is good. However, the sensor-paths in the output are from the traffic-collector
  module, which is unrelated to ACL operational counters. The expected sensor-paths
  are from the Cisco-IOS-XR-acl-oper module, directly related to ACL hit counts and
  interface bindings. The output's sensor-paths do not match the user's request for
  ACL operational counters, so the relevance is low. The sample interval differs but
  that is not penalized. Overall, the output partially meets the protocol and destination
  requirements but fails to provide relevant sensor-paths for ACL counters, resulting
  in a low score.
