rationale: The output correctly configures telemetry model-driven monitoring for CPU
  and memory utilization using gRPC with no TLS to the specified server IP and port,
  matching the user's request. The protocol, encoding, destination IP, and port are
  all correct. The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to CPU and memory utilization,
  though they differ from the reference paths; the output uses telemetry-model-driven
  operational paths while the reference uses procfs and wdsysmon paths. Both sets
  are valid for monitoring CPU and memory utilization. The sensor-group and destination-group
  names differ but this is not penalized. Overall, the output satisfies the user request
  well with minor differences in sensor-path choices.
