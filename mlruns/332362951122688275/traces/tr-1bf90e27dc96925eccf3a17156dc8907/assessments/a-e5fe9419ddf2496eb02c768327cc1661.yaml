rationale: 'The model output does not meet the user''s request and is not functionally
  equivalent to the expected configuration. The user requested a telemetry configuration
  to stream BFD data to 192.0.2.100 port 57000 using gRPC with TLS. The model output
  incorrectly sets ''protocol grpc no-tls'', i.e., no TLS, which violates the TLS
  requirement. Additionally, the sensor-group paths differ: the model uses ''Cisco-IOS-XR-bfd-oper:bfd''
  while the expected uses ''Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-bfd-oper:bfd/counters'' and ''/sessions''
  paths, which are more precise for BFD stats. The model output uses encoding ''self-describing-gpb''
  while the expectation is ''json''. The destination group names differ, which is
  acceptable if logically consistent, but the missing TLS and different sensor paths
  mean the model output is not functionally equivalent to the expected response or
  fulfilling the prompt requirements.'
