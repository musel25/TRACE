rationale: 'The model output does not match the expected configuration in several
  important aspects. The expected response specifies a sensor group named ISIS-STATS
  with sensor-paths related to ''isis/instances/instance/topologies/topology/ipv4-routes/ipv4-route'',
  and uses TCP protocol with JSON encoding. The destination group is DG-ISIS with
  address-family ipv4 to 10.10.10.10 port 5432.


  In contrast, the model output defines a sensor group ISIS-STATE with multiple distinct
  sensor-paths not present in the expected config. It sets protocol grpc no-tls instead
  of tcp, uses self-describing-gpb encoding instead of json, names the destination-group
  DG-GRPC instead of DG-ISIS, and organizes the destination differently.


  Essentially, the model-generated config is neither structurally equivalent nor functionally
  aligned with the user''s prompt and the expected response. It configures gRPC telemetry
  rather than TCP with JSON encoding as requested, and the sensor-paths do not match
  the intended ISIS statistics data. Therefore, the output is not acceptable.'
