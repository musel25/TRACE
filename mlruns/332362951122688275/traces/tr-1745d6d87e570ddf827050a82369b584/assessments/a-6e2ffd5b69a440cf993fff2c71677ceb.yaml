rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for LACP operational
  monitoring using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port,
  matching the user's request. The destination IP, port, protocol, and encoding are
  all correct. The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to LACP/EtherChannel operational
  data (bundles, members, counters), which aligns well with the user's request, even
  though they differ from the reference paths. The sensor-group and destination-group
  names differ but this is acceptable. The sample-interval is not explicitly requested,
  so the default is acceptable. Overall, the output meets the user's requirements
  with only minor differences from the reference, resulting in a high score.
