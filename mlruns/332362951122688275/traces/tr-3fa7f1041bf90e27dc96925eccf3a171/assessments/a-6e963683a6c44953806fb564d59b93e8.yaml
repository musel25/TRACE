rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for VRF operational
  monitoring using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port,
  matching the user's request. The destination IP (192.0.2.117), port (57500), protocol
  (grpc no-tls), and encoding (self-describing-gpb) are all correct as requested.
  The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to VRF state and route-targets, though they
  differ slightly in path details compared to the reference; this is acceptable as
  the user did not specify exact sensor-paths. The sample-interval differs (30000
  ms vs 120000 ms), but since the user did not specify an interval, this is not penalized.
  Naming differences in sensor-group, destination-group, and subscription are ignored
  per instructions. Overall, the output meets the user requirements well with only
  minor acceptable differences.
