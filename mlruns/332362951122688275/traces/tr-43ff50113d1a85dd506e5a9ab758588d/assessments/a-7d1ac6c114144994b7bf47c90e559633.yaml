rationale: The model output fails to meet the user request and the expected configuration
  in several key aspects. Firstly, the sensor-group in the output uses 'BFD-STATE'
  with a sensor-path 'Cisco-IOS-XR-manageability-object-tracking-cfg:bfds', which
  is unrelated to BFD telemetry data as expected; the expectation uses sensor-paths
  under 'Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-bfd-oper' including 'bfd/counters' and 'bfd/sessions' which
  are the relevant BFD operational data. Secondly, the output specifies 'protocol
  grpc no-tls' while the user request and expected config require 'grpc tls' to enable
  secure telemetry streaming. Thirdly, the encoding in the output is 'self-describing-gpb'
  while the expected is 'json'. Also, the destination-group and its nesting are different;
  the expected config nests address-family ipv4 and related parameters properly; the
  output is structured differently and lacks the required flags. The subscription's
  destination group-id and other identifiers differ and do not align with the expected
  names. Overall, the model output does not produce a functionally equivalent telemetry
  configuration that satisfies the prompt to stream BFD data over grpc tls to the
  specified IP and port.
