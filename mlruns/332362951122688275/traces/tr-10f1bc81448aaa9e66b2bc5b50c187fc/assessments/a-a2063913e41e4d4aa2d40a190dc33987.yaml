rationale: 'The model output is not functionally equivalent to the expected response
  for several important reasons: 1) Sensor-groups differ significantly. The model
  output uses ''OSPF-INFO'' with sensor-path ''Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-xtc-oper:pce-topology/...''
  which is unrelated to OSPF statistics. The expected output uses ''OSPF-STATS'' and
  sensor-paths for OSPF database and areas (''Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-ospf-oper:ospf/processes/process/vrfs/vrf/database''
  and ''.../areas''). 2) The destination group names are different: model output uses
  ''DG-GRPC'' with grpc protocol, contradicting the user''s request for tcp. The expected
  uses ''DG-OSPF'' with protocol tcp as requested. 3) The model output specifies ''protocol
  grpc no-tls'' which conflicts with the prompt''s ''protocol: tcp.'' 4) The destination
  group placement and formatting differ; expected places destination-group after subscription
  and configures address-family inline with destination and port. 5) The model output’s
  sensor paths do not correspond to OSPF telemetry but to PCE topology data, irrelevant
  to OSPF protocol config requested. Therefore, the model output does not meet the
  functional intent and structure per the user''s request and is not acceptable.'
