rationale: The model output does provide a telemetry configuration for CEF/FIB operational
  monitoring using gRPC with no TLS and the specified telemetry server and port. However,
  it uses different sensor paths related to 'Cisco-IOS-XR-ofa-dpt-oper:data-path-telemetry'
  instead of the expected 'Cisco-IOS-XR-fib-common-oper:fib/nodes/node/*' sensor paths
  for FIB operational data. Additionally, the sensor-group and subscription names
  differ, and the sample-interval is 30000ms instead of the expected 60000ms. The
  destination group name is different as well. These differences in sensor paths and
  configuration details imply that the model's output is not functionally equivalent
  to the expected configuration. Therefore, the output is not acceptable for the user
  request.
