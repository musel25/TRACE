rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for CEF/FIB operational
  monitoring using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port,
  matching the user's request. The protocol and encoding are correct. The sensor-paths
  chosen are relevant to data-path telemetry, which aligns with forwarding entries
  and statistics monitoring, though they differ from the reference which uses fib-common-oper
  paths. The sample interval differs but is not penalized. Overall, the configuration
  meets the user's requirements well despite differences in sensor-path naming and
  grouping.
