rationale: 'The model output differs significantly from the expected response in several
  critical aspects related to the telemetry configuration for streaming ISIS data
  via gRPC TLS:


  1. Sensor Group and Sensor Paths: The expected response uses the sensor group ISIS-STATS
  with sensor paths specific to Cisco-IOS-XR-clns-isis-oper, focusing on ISIS instances,
  statistics, and neighbors. The model uses a different sensor group ISIS-INFO with
  sensor paths related to Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-xtc-agent-oper and Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-xtc-oper,
  which are unrelated to ISIS statistics and neighbors.


  2. Destination Group Configuration: The expected destination group DG-ISIS uses
  IPv4 with the provided IP and port, encoding set to gpb, and protocol grpc tls,
  matching the prompt''s requirement for grpc tls.


  In contrast, the model configures DG-GRPC with no-tls protocol, which contradicts
  the prompt''s requirement for tls.


  3. Subscription: The model subscription references different sensor-group-id and
  destination-group-id names inconsistent with the expected configuration.


  4. Sample Interval: The expected sample interval is 120000 milliseconds, while the
  model uses 30000 milliseconds.


  Overall, the model output does not fulfill the explicit requirements of the prompt
  to create IOS XR telemetry config streaming ISIS data over grpc tls to the specified
  IP and port. The differences in sensor paths, protocols (no tls vs tls), encoding,
  and destination group make the output functionally incorrect and not equivalent.'
