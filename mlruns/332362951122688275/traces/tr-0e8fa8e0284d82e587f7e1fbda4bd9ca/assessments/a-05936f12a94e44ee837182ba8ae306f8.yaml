rationale: The model output does not meet the expectations provided in several key
  aspects. First, the sensor-group in the model output is named 'ISIS-DATA' with a
  single generic sensor-path 'Cisco-IOS-XR-clns-isis-oper:isis', whereas the expected
  response uses 'ISIS-STATS' and includes specific sensor-paths targeting ISIS instance
  statistics and neighbors, which are more precise and likely more relevant. Second,
  the destination-group in the model output is named 'DG-GRPC' and its structure differs
  from the expected 'DG-ISIS'; notably, the model output has the 'destination' and
  'port' attributes nested under 'address-family ipv4' but with an explicit 'destination
  192.0.2.10' line, whereas the expected config has a different syntax format. Third,
  and most importantly, the model output sets 'protocol grpc no-tls' explicitly, contradicting
  the user prompt's request to use 'grpc tls'. The expected response correctly sets
  'protocol grpc tls'. Additionally, the encoding used is 'self-describing-gpb' in
  the model output, whereas the expected config uses 'gpb', likely the preferred or
  standard encoding. Lastly, the subscription parameters differ between sample intervals
  and destination-group references. Because of these functional differences — particularly
  the non-use of TLS and missing specific sensor-paths — the model output is not acceptable
  or functionally equivalent to the expected configuration for the user request.
