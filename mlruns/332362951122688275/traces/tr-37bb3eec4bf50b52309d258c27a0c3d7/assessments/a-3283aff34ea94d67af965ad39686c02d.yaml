rationale: 'The model output does include a telemetry model-driven configuration related
  to OSPF, but it does not fully match the expected reference configuration. Key differences
  are: 1) Sensor paths: The model uses a single sensor-path ''Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-ospf-oper:ospf-state''
  while the reference expects two specific sensor-paths under OSPF, i.e., ''ospf/processes/process/vrfs/vrf/database''
  and ''ospf/processes/process/vrfs/vrf/areas'', which are more detailed and relevant
  to OSPF process information. 2) Destination group name: The model output uses ''DG-GRPC''
  whereas the reference uses ''DG-OSPF''. 3) Protocol: The model sets protocol as
  ''grpc no-tls'' while the prompt and reference specify ''tcp''. 4) Destination group
  structure: The model nests ''destination'', ''port'', ''protocol'', and ''encoding''
  under ''address-family ipv4'' but without the correct syntax or grouping matching
  the reference (the reference places the address ''10.20.20.10'' and port ''57400''
  after ''address-family ipv4'' on the same line and within the destination-group
  block). 5) The subscription block in the output is similar but the destination-group-id
  refers to ''DG-GRPC'' instead of ''DG-OSPF'' as expected. Because of these discrepancies,
  the model output is not functionally equivalent to the expected configuration and
  would potentially result in incorrect telemetry configuration for OSPF on IOS XR
  as requested.'
