rationale: The model output configures telemetry with a sensor-group named 'ISIS-DATA'
  that subscribes to the entire ISIS data path ('Cisco-IOS-XR-clns-isis-oper:isis'),
  but the expected config uses a sensor-group 'ISIS-STATS' sourcing specific sensor-paths
  for ISIS statistics and neighbors, which is more precise and aligned with the usual
  ISIS telemetry data collection. The model's destination-group is named 'DG-GRPC'
  with 'protocol grpc no-tls' (i.e., no TLS), while the expected config's destination-group
  'DG-ISIS' uses 'protocol grpc tls' as requested by the user. Additionally, the model
  specifies 'encoding self-describing-gpb' instead of 'encoding gpb' as in the expected
  config, which represents a difference in data encoding format. The sample-interval
  in the model's subscription is 30000 ms versus 120000 ms in the expected, a minor
  difference but still notable. Importantly, the model explicitly specifies 'no-tls'
  protocol, contradicting the user's requirement for 'grpc tls' as per the prompt.
  Therefore, the model output does not satisfy the user's request for streaming ISIS
  data with grpc over TLS to the specified address and port, and the sensor-paths
  don't exactly match the intent of gathering ISIS statistics and neighbors as expected.
