rationale: The provided model output does not match the expected response in terms
  of sensor-group names, sensor paths, subscription names, destination group names,
  and structural details. The model output uses 'OPTICS-PROTOCOL' as the sensor group
  and a sensor path 'controller-port-mode/optics-name/port-mode-info' which is incorrect
  and unrelated to the Cisco IOS XR optics operational statistics model. The expected
  sensor-path is 'Cisco-IOS-XR-controller-optics-oper:optics-oper/optics-ports/optics-port/optics-info',
  which is a valid model-driven path for optics telemetry on IOS XR. Additionally,
  the subscription sample interval in the model output is 30000 ms, whereas the expected
  is 120000 ms, and the destination group naming and structure differ. The model output
  uses 'destination-group DG-GRPC' while the expected uses 'destination-group DG-Optics'
  and includes address-family specifics differently. Therefore, the model output is
  not functionally equivalent or acceptable for the user request.
