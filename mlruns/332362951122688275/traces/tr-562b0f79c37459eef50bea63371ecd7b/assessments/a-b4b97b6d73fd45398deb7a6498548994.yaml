rationale: The model output does not meet the expectations for the user's prompt.
  The user requested telemetry configuration for NetFlow/flow monitor operational
  statistics (exporter, cache, drops) with specific telemetry server IP and gRPC with
  no TLS. The expected configuration includes specific sensor-paths to Cisco-IOS-XR-flowspec-oper:flow
  and Cisco-IOS-XR-netflow-oper:net-flow/nodes/node/exporters, which are relevant
  to NetFlow monitoring. The model output uses sensor-paths that do not correspond
  to these NetFlow-specific paths; instead, it uses Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-oper:telemetry-model-driven
  which is generic and unrelated to NetFlow statistics. Additionally, the sensor-group,
  destination group, and subscription names differ from the expected ones, potentially
  leading to mismatch in intended monitoring objectives. The sample-interval in the
  model output is 30000 while expectation is 60000. Overall, the model output is functionally
  incorrect and not equivalent to the expected configuration required by the user.
