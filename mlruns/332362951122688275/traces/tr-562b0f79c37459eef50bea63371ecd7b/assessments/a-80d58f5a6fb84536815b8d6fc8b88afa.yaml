rationale: The output uses gRPC no-tls and the correct destination IP and port as
  requested, which is good. However, the sensor-paths in the output are unrelated
  to NetFlow/flow monitor operational statistics; they reference telemetry-model-driven
  destinations and data-path telemetry rx-port-histogram, which do not match the user's
  request for exporter, cache, and drops statistics. The expected sensor-paths are
  from Cisco-IOS-XR-flowspec-oper and Cisco-IOS-XR-netflow-oper modules, which are
  more relevant. Also, the output uses a different sensor-group and destination-group
  name, but that is acceptable. The sample-interval differs but is not penalized.
  Overall, the output fails to provide relevant sensor-paths for NetFlow operational
  stats, resulting in a low score.
