rationale: 'The model output does not meet the user request or align with the expected
  configuration. Key differences include: 1) Sensor group name and sensor-path differ
  significantly (''ENVIRONMENT'' with ''telemetry-model-driven/environment/protocol''
  in model output versus ''Environment-STATS'' with ''Cisco-IOS-XR-sysadmin-envmon-ui:environment/oper''
  in expectation). 2) Encoding is ''self-describing-gpb'' in output but ''json'' as
  requested and expected. 3) Destination group name does not match (''DG-GRPC'' vs
  ''DG-Environment''). 4) Subscription sample interval is 30000 (30 seconds) in output
  compared to 60000 (60 seconds) in expectation. 5) The destination group configuration
  in the model output is more nested and incorrectly structured, missing correct encoding
  and port placement as expected. Overall, the model output does not conform to the
  user''s input requirements nor the expected config and is therefore functionally
  incorrect.'
