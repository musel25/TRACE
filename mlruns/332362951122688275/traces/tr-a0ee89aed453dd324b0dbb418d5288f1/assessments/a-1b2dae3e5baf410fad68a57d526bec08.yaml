rationale: 'The model output has several discrepancies from the expected configuration.
  First, the sensor group name and sensor-paths differ: the output uses ''BFD-STATE''
  with a sensor-path related to ''bundlemgr-oper'', which is unrelated to BFD operational
  data, whereas the expected config uses ''BFD-STATS'' with sensor-paths ''Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-bfd-oper:bfd/counters''
  and ''Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-bfd-oper:bfd/sessions'' that directly reflect BFD data. Second,
  the destination-group name differs: output uses ''DG-GRPC'' while expected uses
  ''DG-BFD''. Third, the protocol and TLS settings are incorrect; output uses ''protocol
  grpc no-tls'' but the prompt and expected config require ''grpc tls''. Fourth, the
  encoding is ''self-describing-gpb'' in output but expected is ''json''. Fifth, the
  syntax and grouping of the destination are inconsistent: output specifies address-family
  ipv4 with separate destination and port lines, while expected embeds IP and port
  in address-family line. Overall, the model output does not meet the prompt requirements
  for streaming BFD data with grpc tls to the correct destination with proper sensor
  paths and encoding, thus is not functionally equivalent or acceptable.'
