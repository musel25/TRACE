rationale: The output correctly configures telemetry for LACP/EtherChannel operational
  monitoring using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port,
  matching the user's request. The protocol, destination IP, and port are accurate.
  The sensor-paths in the output are relevant to LACP operational data, though they
  differ from the reference paths; however, they still cover LACP bundles, members,
  and counters, which aligns with the user request. The sample interval is acceptable
  and not penalized. Minor differences in sensor-group and destination-group names,
  as well as sensor-path namespaces, are acceptable. Overall, the output meets the
  core requirements well, but the sensor-paths could be more aligned with the typical
  operational paths as in the reference.
