rationale: 'The model output does not meet the user request or the expected configuration
  in several key aspects:


  1. Sensor Groups and Sensor Paths: The expected response includes sensor-group ''BFD-STATS''
  with sensor-paths ''Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-bfd-oper:bfd/counters'' and ''Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-bfd-oper:bfd/sessions''.
  The model output uses sensor-group ''BFD-STATE'' with a sensor-path related to ''Cisco-IOS-XR-bundlemgr-oper'',
  which is unrelated to BFD data. This means the telemetry data will not be the BFD
  statistics as requested.


  2. Destination Group and Protocol: The expected response specifies ''destination-group
  DG-BFD'' with protocol ''grpc tls'', while the model output uses ''destination-group
  DG-GRPC'' with ''protocol grpc no-tls'' (explicitly no TLS). This contradicts the
  user''s request for grpc with TLS.


  3. Encoding: The expected encoding is ''json'', while the model uses ''self-describing-gpb''.


  4. Subscription Configuration: In the expected response, subscription references
  ''destination-group DG-BFD'', whereas the model output references ''destination-group-id
  DG-GRPC''. The naming isn''t the problem, but this group doesn''t match the expected
  destination group with correct protocol and encoding.


  Overall, the model output fails to implement the key parts of the user''s prompt
  to stream BFD data over grpc with TLS to the specified address and port, using the
  relevant sensor paths. Therefore, it is not functionally equivalent or acceptable.'
