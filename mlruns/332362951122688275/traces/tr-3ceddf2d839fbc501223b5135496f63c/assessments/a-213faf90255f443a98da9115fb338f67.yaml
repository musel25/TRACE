rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for ACL operational
  counters using gRPC no-tls to the specified server IP and port, matching the user's
  request. The destination IP (192.0.2.114), port (57500), protocol (grpc no-tls),
  and encoding (self-describing-gpb) are all correct. The sensor-paths chosen are
  relevant to ACL operational counters, covering hit counts per ACE and interface
  bindings, which aligns well with the user's request. The sample-interval differs
  from the reference but is not penalized as the user did not specify it. The only
  minor difference is the sensor-group and subscription names, which are not penalized.
  Overall, the configuration meets the user's requirements effectively.
