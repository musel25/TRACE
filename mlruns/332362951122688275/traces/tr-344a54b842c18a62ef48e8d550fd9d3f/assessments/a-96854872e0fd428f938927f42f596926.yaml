rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for QoS policy-map
  statistics using gRPC no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port, matching
  the user's request. The protocol, encoding, and destination details are accurate.
  The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to QoS statistics, though they differ from
  the expected reference paths which use the 'oper' data model and more specific paths
  under nodes and interfaces. The output uses 'cfg' model paths which may not provide
  operational statistics as requested. However, the overall configuration meets the
  core user requirements, so the score is high but not perfect due to sensor-path
  model differences.
