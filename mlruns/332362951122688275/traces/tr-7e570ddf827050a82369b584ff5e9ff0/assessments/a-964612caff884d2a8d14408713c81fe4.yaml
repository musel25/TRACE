rationale: The model output and the expected response differ significantly in key
  aspects of the IOS XR telemetry configuration. The model output uses a sensor group
  named 'EVPN-TELEMETRY' with multiple detailed sensor-paths, whereas the expected
  response uses 'EVPN-STATS' with a single specified sensor-path 'Cisco-IOS-XR-evpn-oper:evpn/nodes/node/evi-detail'.
  Furthermore, the destination-group in the output is named 'DG-GRPC' with 'grpc no-tls'
  protocol and 'self-describing-gpb' encoding, while the expected response's destination-group
  is 'DG-EVPN' using TCP protocol and JSON encoding as requested ('tcp' in the prompt).
  The sample interval of 30000ms is consistent, but the destination and subscription
  group names, encoding, protocol, and sensor paths differ and are not functionally
  equivalent. Hence, the output is not acceptable as it does not match the user's
  explicit request for model-driven telemetry for EVPN on IOS XR with TCP protocol
  and JSON encoding targeting the server 10.10.10.10:57000 with 30000ms interval.
