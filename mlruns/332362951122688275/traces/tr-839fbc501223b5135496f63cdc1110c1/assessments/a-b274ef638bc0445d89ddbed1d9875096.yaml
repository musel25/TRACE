rationale: The model output does not match the expected configuration in several key
  aspects. The expected response specifies the sensor-group as 'Optics-STATS' with
  a sensor-path pointing to 'Cisco-IOS-XR-controller-optics-oper:optics-oper/optics-ports/optics-port/optics-info',
  whereas the model output uses 'OPTICS-PROTOCOL' with 'controller-port-mode/optics-name/port-mode-info',
  which is different and likely incorrect for the Optics protocol on IOS XR. Furthermore,
  the destination-group and subscription definitions differ; the expected response
  includes 'DG-Optics' with the address family, IP, port, encoding, and protocol in
  a specific structure, while the model output defines 'DG-GRPC' and splits the address
  family and destination differently. Also, the sample-interval in the model output
  is 30000 ms compared to the expected 120000 ms. These discrepancies indicate the
  model output is not functionally equivalent to the expectation and does not fulfill
  the user's prompt as intended.
