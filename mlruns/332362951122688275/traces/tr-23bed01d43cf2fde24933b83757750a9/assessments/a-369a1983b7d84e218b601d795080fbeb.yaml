rationale: 'The model output does create an IOS XR telemetry configuration to stream
  ISIS data to 192.0.2.10 on port 57500 using gRPC. However, there are significant
  mismatches compared to the expected configuration:


  1. Sensor-Group Name and Sensor-Paths: The model output uses "ISIS-INFO" with a
  set of sensor-paths mostly from Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-xtc-agent-oper and Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-xtc-oper
  modules, which do not correspond to the expected sensor-paths under "ISIS-STATS"
  from Cisco-IOS-XR-clns-isis-oper with paths for isis/instances/instance/statistics
  and neighbors.


  2. Sample Interval: Model output uses 30000 ms; expected is 120000 ms.


  3. Destination-Group and Destination Configuration: The model output destination
  group is "DG-GRPC" with protocol "grpc no-tls" and encoding "self-describing-gpb",
  while the expectation is "DG-ISIS" with protocol "grpc tls" and encoding "gpb".


  4. Destination group address-family syntax differs; the expected response shows
  the address and port in a single line with sub-indentation, while model output separates
  these.


  Because of these differences, particularly that the model output does not enable
  TLS as requested in the prompt and does not match the expected sensor paths and
  sample intervals, it is not functionally equivalent or acceptable.'
