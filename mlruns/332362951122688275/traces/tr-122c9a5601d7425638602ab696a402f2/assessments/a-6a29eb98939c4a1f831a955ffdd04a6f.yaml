rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for IOS XR 7.0.1
  with gRPC no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port, matching the user's
  request. The protocol, encoding, and destination details are accurate. The sensor-paths
  chosen relate to route counters for IPv4 and IPv6, which are relevant to routing
  information base (RIB) summary and route counters as requested, though the exact
  sensor-paths differ from the reference. The sample interval differs (30000 vs 60000)
  but this is not penalized. Overall, the configuration meets the user's requirements
  well, with minor differences in sensor-path naming and grouping that do not reduce
  relevance.
