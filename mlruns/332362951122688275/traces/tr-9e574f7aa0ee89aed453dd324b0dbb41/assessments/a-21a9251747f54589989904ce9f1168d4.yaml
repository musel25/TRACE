rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for VRF operational
  monitoring using gRPC no-tls to the specified telemetry server IP and port, matching
  the user's request. The protocol, destination IP, and port are accurate. However,
  the sensor-paths used in the output are from the traffic-collector module, which
  is less relevant to VRF operational state and route-targets compared to the expected
  sensor-paths from the infra-rsi-oper module that directly relate to VRF and route-targets.
  The sample-interval differs but is not penalized as the user did not specify it.
  Naming differences in groups and subscriptions are not penalized. Overall, the configuration
  meets the core requirements but could be improved by using more relevant sensor-paths
  for VRF operational monitoring.
