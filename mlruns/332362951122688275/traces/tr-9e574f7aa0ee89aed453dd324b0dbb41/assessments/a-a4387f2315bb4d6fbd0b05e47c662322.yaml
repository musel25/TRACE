rationale: 'The model output fails to meet the user''s request and the expected configuration
  in several key areas. First, the sensor-paths used in the output are from ''Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-tc-oper:traffic-collector/vrf-table'',
  which is unrelated to VRF operational states and route-targets; the expected sensor-paths
  are from ''Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-rsi-oper:rsi/vrfs/vrf'' including route-targets, which
  directly relate to VRF operational monitoring. Second, the destination group name
  ''DG-GRPC'' in the output does not match the expected ''DG-VRF'', which suggests
  a lack of alignment with the intended telemetry endpoint naming convention. Third,
  the subscription name and sample interval differ: output uses ''SUB-VRF-OPER'' with
  a 30000 ms sample interval, while the expected uses ''SUB-VRF'' with a 120000 ms
  interval, indicating non-conformance in subscription setup. Finally, the prompt
  requests gRPC with no TLS, which is properly set in both, but the overall telemetry
  configuration does not correspond in structure or detail to the expected configuration.
  Therefore, the model output is not functionally equivalent to the reference and
  is not acceptable.'
