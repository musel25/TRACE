rationale: The model output configures the telemetry for ISIS but differs significantly
  from the expected configuration in several key aspects. Firstly, the sensor-group
  in the model output is named 'ISIS-STATE' with a sensor-path focusing on 'isis/instances/instance',
  while the expected config uses 'ISIS-STATS' with a detailed sensor-path including
  'topologies/topology/ipv4-routes/ipv4-route', which is more specific and relevant
  to ISIS routing statistics. Secondly, the model output uses gRPC protocol with encoding
  'self-describing-gpb' and no TLS, whereas the expected config specifies TCP protocol
  with JSON encoding. Additionally, the destination group names differ ('DG-GRPC'
  vs 'DG-ISIS'), and the formatting and structure of the destination configuration
  differ, with the expected output having a clear nesting under 'destination-group
  DG-ISIS' including the address-family, address, port, encoding, and protocol. These
  differences imply that the model output does not meet the user's request accurately
  for telemetry configuration of ISIS with the specified parameters (protocol tcp,
  encoding json, sensor paths related to ISIS statistics). Therefore, the model output
  is not functionally equivalent to the expected reference configuration and is not
  acceptable.
