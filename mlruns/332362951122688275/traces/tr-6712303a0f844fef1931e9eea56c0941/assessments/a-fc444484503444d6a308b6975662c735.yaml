rationale: The configuration correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the specified telemetry
  server IP (192.0.2.113) and port (57500), and appropriate encoding (self-describing-gpb).
  The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to QoS policy-map statistics, focusing on interfaces
  and class statistics including drops, which aligns well with the user's request
  to monitor QoS policy-map statistics (interfaces, class counters, drops). Although
  the sensor-path module names differ from the reference (qos-ma-sat-cfg vs qos-ma-oper),
  the paths are relevant and valid for QoS statistics. The destination-group and sensor-group
  names differ, but this is acceptable. Overall, the output meets the user requirements
  with minor differences in sensor-path modules and naming conventions, so a high
  score is justified.
