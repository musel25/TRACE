rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for CEF/FIB operational
  monitoring using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port,
  matching the user's request. The protocol and encoding are correct. The sensor-paths
  chosen are relevant to data-path telemetry, which is related to forwarding entries
  and statistics, though they differ from the reference which uses fib-common-oper
  paths. This difference is acceptable as the output sensor-paths are still relevant
  to the requested domain. The sample-interval differs but this is not penalized.
  Overall, the configuration meets the user's requirements well with minor differences
  in sensor-path selection.
