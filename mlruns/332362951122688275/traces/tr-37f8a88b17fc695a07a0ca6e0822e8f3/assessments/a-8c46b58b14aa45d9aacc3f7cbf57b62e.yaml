rationale: The output correctly uses gRPC with no TLS and the specified destination
  IP and port, matching the user's request. The encoding is also correct. However,
  the sensor-path used in the output is from 'Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-rib-ipv4-oper' and focuses
  on a specific protocol client, which is less comprehensive and less relevant than
  the expected sensor-paths that cover both IPv4 and IPv6 unicast RIBs and RIB summary,
  as requested. The sample interval differs but is not penalized. Overall, the output
  partially meets the request but lacks the full coverage of routing information base
  summary and route counters for both IPv4 and IPv6 as expected.
