rationale: "The model output does not meet the user request or match the expected
  reference configuration. The user requested telemetry configuration for Cisco IOS
  XR 7.0.1 to stream routing information base (RIB) summary and route counters for
  both IPv4 and IPv6, using gRPC with no TLS, to a telemetry server 192.0.2.111 on
  port 57500, choosing relevant sensor-paths. The expected response uses sensor-paths
  under \"Cisco-IOS-XR-rib-oper\" for IPv4-unicast, IPv6-unicast, and summary routes,
  and configures a sensor-group named RIB-OPER with a sample-interval of 60000ms,
  destination group DG-RIB, and subscription SUB-RIB. \n\nThe model output uses a
  different sensor-group name \"RIB-SUMMARY-ROUTE-COUNTERS\" and a sensor-path \"Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-rib-ipv4-oper\"
  that does not match the expected sensor-paths and does not cover IPv6. Also, the
  destination-group is named DG-GRPC rather than DG-RIB, and the sample-interval is
  30000ms instead of 60000ms. The model output only configures address-family ipv4,
  ignoring IPv6. Additionally, the sensor-path used in the model output seems unrelated
  to routing summary and route counters as per typical IOS XR telemetry. Therefore,
  the model output is not functionally equivalent to the reference or correct per
  the user prompt."
