rationale: 'The model output configuration differs significantly from the expected
  configuration in several key aspects: the sensor-group name and sensor-path are
  different; the encoding is ''self-describing-gpb'' in the model output instead of
  ''json'' as requested; the sample interval is 30000 in the model output versus 60000
  in the expectation; the destination-group names differ; the structure and order
  of the configuration commands differ; the destination-group specification does not
  match the expected format. Given these discrepancies affect the intent and function
  of the telemetry configuration, the model output is not functionally equivalent
  to the expected configuration.'
