rationale: The output correctly configures telemetry model-driven for VRF operational
  monitoring using gRPC no-tls to the specified server IP and port, matching the user's
  request. The protocol, destination IP, and port are accurate. However, the sensor-paths
  used in the output are from the traffic-collector module, which is less relevant
  to VRF operational state and route-targets compared to the expected sensor-paths
  from the infra-rsi-oper module that directly relate to VRF state and route-targets.
  The sample-interval differs but is not penalized as the user did not specify it.
  Overall, the configuration meets the core requirements but could be improved by
  using more relevant sensor-paths for VRF operational monitoring.
