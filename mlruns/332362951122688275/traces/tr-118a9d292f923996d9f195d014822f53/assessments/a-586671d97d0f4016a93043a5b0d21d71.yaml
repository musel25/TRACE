rationale: 'The model output partially meets the requirement by configuring telemetry
  for ISIS on IOS XR with the specified server address 10.10.10.10 and port 5432,
  and a sample interval of 60000ms. However, there are several discrepancies that
  make it functionally different from the expected configuration:


  1. Sensor-Group Name and Sensor-Path: The output uses sensor-group ISIS-TELEMETRY
  with sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-clns-isis-oper:isis, while the expected config uses
  ISIS-STATS and a more specific sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-clns-isis-oper:isis/instances/instance/topologies/topology/ipv4-routes/ipv4-route.
  The expected config specifies detailed route telemetry, which is more precise.


  2. Destination Group and Protocol: The model output defines the destination group
  DG-GRPC using grpc protocol with no-tls and encoding ''self-describing-gpb'', which
  is gRPC based encoding. The expected config uses destination group DG-ISIS with
  tcp protocol and encoding json, which matches the user request ''tcp'' and no mention
  of grpc.


  3. Subscription block: The model''s subscription references destination-group-id
  DG-GRPC, whereas expected references destination-group DG-ISIS. This affects the
  data flow destination.


  4. Formatting details: The expected response includes some additional ''!'' line
  breaks and slightly different indentation, but these are minor.


  Given these differences, the model output does not produce a functionally equivalent
  configuration relevant to the user''s specific requirements concerning transport
  protocol (tcp), encoding (json), and detailed ISIS telemetry path. Hence, it is
  not acceptable as per the defined criteria.'
