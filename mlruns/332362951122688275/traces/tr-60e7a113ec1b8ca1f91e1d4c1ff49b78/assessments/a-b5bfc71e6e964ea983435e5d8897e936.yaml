rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for QoS policy-map
  statistics using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port,
  matching the user's request. The protocol, encoding, and destination details are
  accurate. The sensor-path used is relevant to QoS policy-map statistics, though
  it is slightly narrower than the reference which includes additional sensor-paths
  for interfaces and class-map. However, the chosen sensor-path is still appropriate
  for monitoring QoS policy-map statistics. Naming differences in sensor-group, destination-group,
  and subscription are not penalized. Overall, the configuration meets the user's
  requirements well with minor differences in sensor-path breadth.
