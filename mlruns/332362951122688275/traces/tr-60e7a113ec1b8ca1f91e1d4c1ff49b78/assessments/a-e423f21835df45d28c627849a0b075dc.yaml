rationale: 'The model output differs significantly from the expected response in multiple
  key areas. The sensor-group name in the model output is ''QOS-POLICY-MAP-STATS'',
  whereas the expected is ''QOS-OPER''. The model output contains only one sensor-path:
  ''Cisco-IOS-XR-qos-ma-oper:qos/nodes/node/policy-map/shared-policy-instances'',
  which is more specific and narrower, whereas the expected includes three sensor-paths:
  ''qos/nodes/node/policy-map'', ''qos/nodes/node/interfaces/interface'', and ''qos/nodes/node/class-map''
  to cover interfaces, class counters, and drops as requested. This means the model
  output is missing relevant sensor-paths essential for monitoring QoS policy-map
  statistics comprehensively. Additionally, the destination-group name in the model
  output is ''DG-GRPC'' compared to ''DG-QOS'' in the expected. The rest of the destination
  details (IPv4 address, port, encoding, protocol) match the request. However, given
  the incomplete sensor-path coverage and different group naming, the model output
  is not functionally equivalent nor adequate for the user''s request to monitor QoS
  policy-map statistics across interfaces, class counters, and drops.'
