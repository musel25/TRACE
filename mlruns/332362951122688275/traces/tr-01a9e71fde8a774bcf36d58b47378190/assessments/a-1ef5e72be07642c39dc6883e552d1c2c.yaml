rationale: The output correctly uses gRPC with no TLS and the specified telemetry
  server IP and port, matching the user's request. However, the sensor-paths included
  in the output are not relevant to CPU and memory operational utilization as requested.
  The user asked specifically for CPU and memory utilization monitoring, but the output
  includes unrelated sensor-paths such as 'data-path-telemetry/sensor/npu-cfg-mem-util'
  and 'data-path-telemetry/sensor/rx-port-histogram'. The reference configuration
  includes sensor-paths directly related to processes, CPU utilization, and memory
  utilization, which are missing in the output. The destination-group and subscription
  naming differences are acceptable. Overall, the output partially meets the request
  but fails to include the correct sensor-paths, resulting in a low score.
