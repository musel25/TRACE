rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for multicast operational
  monitoring focusing on PIM and IGMP neighbors, groups, and interfaces, as requested.
  It uses gRPC with no TLS, the specified server IP 192.0.2.116, and port 57500, matching
  the user request exactly. The encoding is self-describing-gpb, consistent with the
  expectation. The sensor-paths are relevant and cover PIM neighbors and interface
  statistics for both IPv4 and IPv6, which is appropriate for multicast monitoring.
  Although the sensor-group and destination-group names differ from the reference,
  this is acceptable. The sample-interval is 30000 ms instead of 60000 ms, but the
  user did not specify a required interval, so this is not penalized. Overall, the
  configuration meets the user requirements well, with minor differences that do not
  affect functionality.
