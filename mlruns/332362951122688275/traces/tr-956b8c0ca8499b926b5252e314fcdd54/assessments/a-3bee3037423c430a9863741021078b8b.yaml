rationale: The configuration correctly uses gRPC with no TLS, the specified telemetry
  server IP 192.0.2.112, and port 57500, matching the user request. The encoding self-describing-gpb
  is consistent with the expectation. The sensor-paths are relevant to CEF/FIB operational
  monitoring, covering forwarding entries and statistics, though the exact sensor-paths
  and sensor-group names differ from the reference. The sample-interval differs but
  is not penalized as the user did not specify it. Overall, the output meets the core
  requirements with minor naming and path variations, so it scores high.
