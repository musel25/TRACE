rationale: The generated telemetry configuration differs significantly from the expected
  reference configuration in several aspects. The sensor groups, including their names
  and sensor-paths, do not match the expected ones; the output uses 'SEGMENT_ROUTING'
  with different sensor-paths that reference different operational data models compared
  to the expected 'Segment_Routing-STATS' with 'Cisco-IOS-XR-segment-routing-ms-oper:srms'
  and 'Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-xtc-agent-oper:xtc/forwarding'. The subscription identifiers
  and sample-intervals differ; the output has 'SUB_SEGMENT_ROUTING' with a 30000 ms
  sample interval, whereas the expected uses 'SUB-Segment_Routing' with 120000 ms.
  Additionally, the destination-group names differ, and the encoding specified does
  not match ('self-describing-gpb' vs 'gpb'), impacting functional compatibility.
  Although the destination address, port, and protocol (grpc no-tls) are consistent,
  the core telemetry sensor data targeted and the subscription settings are not equivalent,
  resulting in a functionally different telemetry configuration. Therefore, the output
  is not acceptable.
