rationale: The output correctly configures telemetry model-driven settings for monitoring
  NetFlow operational statistics, using gRPC no TLS to the specified server IP and
  port, which matches the user request. The protocol, destination IP, and port are
  accurate. The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to NetFlow statistics (exporter,
  cache, drops), which aligns well with the user's request to monitor exporter, cache,
  and drops statistics. The sample interval differs from the reference but is not
  penalized as the user did not specify it. The main difference is in the sensor-path
  namespaces and specific paths used; the output uses Cisco-IOS-XR-dnx-netflow-oper
  paths, while the reference uses Cisco-IOS-XR-netflow-oper and flowspec paths. However,
  the output's sensor-paths are clearly relevant to NetFlow operational statistics,
  so this is acceptable. Overall, the output satisfies the user request well with
  minor differences in sensor-path details and naming, resulting in a high but not
  perfect score.
