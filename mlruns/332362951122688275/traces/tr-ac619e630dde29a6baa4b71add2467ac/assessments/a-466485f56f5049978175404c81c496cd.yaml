rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for CEF/FIB operational
  monitoring using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port,
  matching the user's request. The protocol and encoding are correct. The sensor-paths
  chosen are relevant to forwarding entries and statistics, though they differ from
  the reference paths but still cover the requested domain. The sample interval differs
  but is not penalized as the user did not specify it. The destination-group and sensor-group
  names differ but are not penalized. Overall, the output meets the user's requirements
  well with minor differences in sensor-path specifics.
