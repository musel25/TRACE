rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for multicast operational
  monitoring including PIM and IGMP neighbors, groups, and interfaces, matching the
  user's request. The destination IP (192.0.2.116), port (57500), protocol (grpc no-tls),
  and encoding (self-describing-gpb) all match the user request exactly. The sensor-paths
  are relevant and detailed, covering both IGMP and PIM operational data, which is
  appropriate for multicast monitoring. The sample-interval differs (30000 ms vs 60000
  ms in reference), but this is not penalized as the user did not specify it. Minor
  differences in sensor-group and destination-group names are acceptable. Overall,
  the configuration meets the user requirements well, hence a high score of 0.9.
