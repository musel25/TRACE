rationale: The output correctly configures telemetry model-driven with gRPC no-tls
  to the specified server IP and port, matching the user's request. The encoding and
  protocol are also correct. However, the sensor-paths used in the output are not
  clearly relevant to CPU and memory operational utilization as requested. The reference
  uses specific Cisco IOS XR operational paths for processes, CPU utilization, and
  memory utilization, which are more appropriate. The output's sensor-paths appear
  unrelated or generic, which reduces the score. Overall, the configuration is mostly
  correct but the sensor-path relevance is insufficient, leading to a moderate score.
