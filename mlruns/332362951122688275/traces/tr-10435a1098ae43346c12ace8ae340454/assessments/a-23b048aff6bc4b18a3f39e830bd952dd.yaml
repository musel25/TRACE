rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for QoS policy-map
  statistics using gRPC with no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and port,
  matching the user's request. The protocol, encoding, and destination details are
  accurate. The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to QoS policy-map statistics, though
  the output uses a slightly different sensor-path hierarchy and omits some paths
  present in the reference. However, these differences do not detract significantly
  from the relevance. The naming of groups and subscriptions differs but is not penalized.
  Overall, the configuration meets the core requirements well with minor deviations
  in sensor-path details.
