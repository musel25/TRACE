rationale: 'The model output and the expected response share the same overall intent:
  configuring telemetry on Cisco IOS XR to monitor L2VPN xconnect/pseudowire operational
  state using gRPC with no TLS to the specified server (192.0.2.110:57500). However,
  there are several key differences that prevent functional equivalence:


  1. Sensor Group Name: The model output uses ''L2VPN-XCONNECT-STATE'' while the expected
  configuration uses ''L2VPN-XCONNECT-OPER''. The names are different, which might
  impact identification or management.


  2. Sensor-Paths: The expected response includes broad paths covering ''active/xconnects'',
  ''active/pseudowires'', and ''active/bridge-domains'', representing a comprehensive
  operational state of L2VPN xconnect and pseudowire. The model output includes more
  detailed, but narrower sensor paths focused on ''remote-signalling/tlv'' and ''local-signalling/tlv''
  under specific segments. While related, the model''s paths are more granular and
  different from the expected groupings.


  3. Destination Group Name: The model output uses ''DG-GRPC'' whereas the expected
  uses ''DG-L2VPN''. The difference is slight but may affect configuration clarity.


  4. Subscription Name and Sample Interval: The model uses subscription ''SUB-L2VPN-XCONNECT''
  with sample-interval 30000 ms (30 seconds), the expected uses ''SUB-L2VPN'' with
  60000 ms (60 seconds). Sample intervals differ.


  5. The expected response includes an additional sensor-path for ''active/bridge-domains''
  which may be important for complete L2VPN monitoring; the model output does not
  include this.


  Given these discrepancies, especially in sensor-path coverage, group names, and
  sample intervals, the model output is not functionally equivalent to the expected
  response and thus is not acceptable for the user''s request.'
