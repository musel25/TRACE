rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for L2VPN xconnect/pseudowire
  operational state using gRPC with no TLS to the specified server IP 192.0.2.110
  and port 57500, matching the user request. The protocol and encoding are also correct.
  The sensor-paths chosen are relevant to L2VPN xconnect and pseudowire operational
  state, though they are more detailed and specific than the reference, which is acceptable.
  The destination-group and subscription names differ but this is allowed. The sample-interval
  differs (30000 ms vs 60000 ms) but the user did not specify a required interval,
  so this is not penalized. Overall, the output meets the user requirements well with
  minor differences in sensor-path granularity and naming.
