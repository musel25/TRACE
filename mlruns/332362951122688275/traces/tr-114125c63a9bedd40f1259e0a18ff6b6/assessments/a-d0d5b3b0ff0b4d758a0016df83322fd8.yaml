rationale: 'The model output and the expected configuration differ significantly in
  several key aspects. The expected destination group is named ''DG-ISIS'' with address
  family ipv4 set to ''10.10.10.20'' on port 57000, encoding ''json'', and protocol
  ''tcp''. The model output uses destination group ''DG-GRPC'' with protocol ''grpc
  no-tls'' and encoding ''self-describing-gpb'', which does not match the user''s
  request for TCP with the specified destination and port. Furthermore, the sensor
  group and sensor-paths differ: the model uses sensor group ''ISIS-IS-IS'' with sensor-path
  ''intermediate-systems/intermediate-system'', whereas the expected uses ''ISIS-STATS''
  with sensor-path ''interfaces''. The sample-intervals and subscription names also
  differ. Given these discrepancies in destination protocol, encoding, sensor path,
  and overall structure, the model output is not functionally equivalent to the expected
  response.'
