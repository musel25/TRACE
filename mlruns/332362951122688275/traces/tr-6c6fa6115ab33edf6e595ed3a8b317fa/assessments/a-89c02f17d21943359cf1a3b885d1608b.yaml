rationale: The output correctly configures model-driven telemetry for LACP/EtherChannel
  operational monitoring using gRPC no TLS to the specified telemetry server IP and
  port, matching the user's request. The protocol, encoding, and destination details
  are accurate. However, the sensor-paths used in the output differ from the expected
  ones; the output uses 'Cisco-IOS-XR-ifmgr-oper' paths related to bundle interfaces
  and counters, while the expected uses 'Cisco-IOS-XR-bundlemgr-oper' and 'Cisco-IOS-XR-lacp-oper'
  paths more directly related to LACP bundles and nodes. Both sets are relevant to
  LACP/EtherChannel monitoring, but the expected paths are more specific to LACP operational
  data. Given the relevance of the output sensor-paths to the domain, the configuration
  is acceptable but not fully aligned with the reference. Overall, the output meets
  the core user requirements with minor deviations in sensor-path specificity.
