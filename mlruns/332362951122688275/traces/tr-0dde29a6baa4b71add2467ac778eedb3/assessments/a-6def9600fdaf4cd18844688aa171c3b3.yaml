rationale: "The model output deviates significantly from the expected configuration
  in several key aspects. Firstly, the sensor-group names differ: the model uses 'SEGMENT_ROUTING'
  with path 'Cisco-IOS-XR-segment-routing-ms-cfg:sr', while the expectation requires
  'Segment_Routing-STATS' with sensor-paths 'Cisco-IOS-XR-segment-routing-ms-oper:srms'
  and 'Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-xtc-agent-oper:xtc/forwarding'. This difference suggests
  the model is targeting a different telemetry data set (configuration data vs operational
  statistics), which affects functionality.\n\nSecondly, the subscription in the model
  references 'SUB_SEGMENT_ROUTING' with a 30000ms sample-interval, whereas the expectation
  uses 'SUB-Segment_Routing' with a 120000ms sample-interval, which may impact data
  sampling frequency according to user requirements.\n\nThirdly, the destination-group
  in the model is 'DG-GRPC' with destination 172.16.1.20 and port 57400, matching
  the expected IP and port, but differs in naming and detailed structure. The model
  includes 'encoding self-describing-gpb' while expectation specifies 'encoding gpb'.\n\nFinally,
  the overall structure and grouping of the configuration differs, notably the destination-group
  placement and attributes. \n\nGiven these discrepancies, especially the critical
  differences in sensor-paths and encoding, the model output is not functionally equivalent
  and is thus unacceptable for the user request."
