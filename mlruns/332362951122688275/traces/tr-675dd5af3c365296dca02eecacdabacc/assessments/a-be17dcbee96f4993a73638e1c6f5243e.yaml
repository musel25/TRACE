rationale: 'The model output does not match the expected configuration for several
  critical reasons. Firstly, the sensor-group name and sensor-path are incorrect:
  the output uses ''INTERFACE-PROTOCOL'' and a sensor-path related to ''linux-networking/global/status/inconsistencies-per-interfaces'',
  which is unrelated to the Interface protocol expected. The expected sensor-group
  is ''Interface-STATS'' with a sensor-path under ''Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper:infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters''.
  Secondly, the destination-group in the output is named ''DG-GRPC'' using gRPC protocol
  with encoding ''self-describing-gpb'' and protocol ''grpc no-tls'', whereas the
  expected uses ''DG-Interface'' with transport protocol TCP, encoding JSON, and no
  mention of gRPC. Thirdly, the subscription configuration structure differs, including
  subscription group IDs and naming conventions. Given these discrepancies in sensor-path
  relevance, transport protocol, encoding, naming, and protocol, the output is not
  functionally equivalent or acceptable compared to the expected configuration.'
