rationale: The model output and the expected response differ significantly in structure,
  sensor-groups, sensor-paths, subscription names, and sample intervals. The user
  requested telemetry configuration for ACL operational counters, including hit counts
  per ACE and interface bindings, specifically using Cisco IOS XR 7.0.1, gRPC with
  no TLS, server 192.0.2.114 on port 57500, and relevant sensor-paths. The expected
  response uses sensor-group 'ACL-OPER' with sensor-paths under Cisco-IOS-XR-acl-oper
  module, including 'acl/active', 'acl/active/vrfs/vrf', and 'acl/active/interfaces/interface',
  which align with the ACL operational counters and interface bindings. The model
  output instead uses sensor-group 'ACL-COUNTERS' with sensor-paths under Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-tc-oper,
  focusing on traffic collector counters, which is unrelated to ACL operational data.
  Additionally, the subscription sample-interval differs (30000ms vs. 60000ms) and
  subscription/destination-group names do not match. Thus, the model output does not
  meet the user's request or is functionally equivalent to the expected configuration.
