rationale: The output correctly uses gRPC with no TLS and the specified server IP
  and port, matching the user's request. The encoding is also correct. However, the
  sensor-paths used in the output are from the traffic-collector operational data,
  which is not directly related to ACL operational counters as requested. The expected
  sensor-paths are from the Cisco-IOS-XR-acl-oper module, which specifically covers
  ACL active entries and interface bindings. The sample interval differs but is not
  penalized. Overall, the output meets the transport and protocol requirements but
  only partially addresses the requested telemetry data, resulting in a moderate score.
