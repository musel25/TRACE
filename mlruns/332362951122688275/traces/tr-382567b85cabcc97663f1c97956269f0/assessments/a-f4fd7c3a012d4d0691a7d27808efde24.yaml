rationale: The output correctly configures telemetry model-driven settings for NetFlow
  operational statistics, using gRPC with no TLS, and the specified telemetry server
  IP and port match the user request. The encoding and protocol are also correctly
  set. The sensor-path used in the output is relevant to NetFlow statistics, though
  it differs from the reference paths; however, it still aligns with the user's request
  to monitor NetFlow/flow monitor operational statistics (exporter, cache, drops).
  The sample-interval differs but is not penalized as the user did not specify it.
  Overall, the configuration meets the core requirements with minor differences in
  sensor-path selection and naming, which are acceptable.
