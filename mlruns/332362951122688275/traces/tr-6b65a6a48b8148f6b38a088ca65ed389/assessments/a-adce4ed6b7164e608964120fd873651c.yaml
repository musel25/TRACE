rationale: The model output differs significantly from the expected response in terms
  of sensor-group naming, sensor paths included, subscription naming, sample interval,
  and destination-group configuration syntax. The model output uses sensor-group 'OPTICS-PROTOCOL'
  with multiple sensor-paths including 'submarine-info' and 'osa-optics-controller',
  while the expected response uses 'Optics-STATS' with a single sensor-path 'optics-info'.
  Also, the model output's subscription 'SUB-OPTICS-PROTOCOL' has a sample-interval
  of 30000, differing from the expected 'SUB-Optics' with 120000. Additionally, the
  destination-group is named 'DG-GRPC' in the model output and 'DG-Optics' in the
  expectation, with different address-family and indentation structures. Therefore,
  the configuration generated by the model is not functionally equivalent to the reference
  expected config.
